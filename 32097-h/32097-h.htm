<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">CONVENTION<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (Lat. _conventio_, an assembly or agreement, from
_convenire_, to come together), a meeting or assembly; an agreement
between parties; a general agreement on which is based some custom,
institution, rule of behaviour or taste, or canon of art; hence extended
to the abuse of such an agreement, whereby the rules based upon it
become lifeless and artificial. The word is of some interest
historically and politically. It is used of an assembly of the
representatives of a nation, state or party, and is particularly
contrasted with the formal meetings of a legislature. It is thus applied
to those parliaments in English history which, owing to the abeyance of
the crown, have assembled without the formal summons of the sovereign;
in 1660 a convention parliament restored Charles II. to the throne, and
in 1689 the Houses of Commons and Lords were summoned informally to a
convention by William, prince of Orange, as were the Estates of
Scotland, and declared the throne abdicated by James II. and settled the
disposition of the realm. Similarly, the assembly which ruled France
from September 1792 to October 1795 was known as the National Convention
(see below); the statutory assembly of delegates which framed the
constitution of the United States of America in 1787 was called the
Constitutional Convention; and the various American state constitutions
have been drafted and sometimes revised by constitutional
conventions. In the party system of the United States the
nomination of party candidates for office or election is in the
hands of delegates, chosen by the primaries, meeting in the
convention of the party; the convention system is universal,
from the national conventions of the Republican and Democratic
parties, which nominate the candidates for the presidency
and vice-presidency, down to a ward convention, which nominates
the candidate for a town-councillorship. In diplomacy,
&ldquo;convention&rdquo; is a general name given to international agreements
other than treaties, but not necessarily differing either
in form or subject-matter from a treaty, and sometimes used
quite widely of all forms of such agreements. Many conventions
have been made for the formation of international
&ldquo;unions&rdquo; to regulate and protect various economic, industrial
and other non-political interests, such as postal and telegraphic
services, trade-marks, patents, copyright, quarantine, &amp;c.
Thus the Latin Monetary Union was created in 1865 by the
Convention of Paris, and the abolition of bounties on the production
and exportation of sugar by the Convention of Brussels
in 1902 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Treaties</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CONVENTION, THE NATIONAL,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> in France, the constitutional
and legislative assembly which sat from the 20th of September
1792 to the 26th of October 1795 (the 4th of Brumaire of the
year IV.). On the 10th of August 1792, when the populace
of Paris stormed the Tuileries and demanded the abolition of
the monarchy, the Legislative Assembly decreed the provisional
suspension of the king and the convocation of a national convention
which should draw up a constitution. At the same time
it was decided that the deputies to that convention should be
elected by all Frenchmen 25 years old, domiciled for a year and
living by the product of their labour. The National Convention
was therefore the first French assembly elected by universal
suffrage, without distinctions of class. The age limit of the
electors was further lowered to 21, and that of eligibility was
fixed at 25 years.</p>

<p>The first session was held on the 20th of September 1792.
The next day royalty was abolished, and on the 22nd it was
decided that all documents should be henceforth dated from the
year I. of the French Republic. The Convention was destined
to last for three years. The country was at war, and it seemed
best to postpone the new constitution until peace should be
concluded. At the same time as the Convention prolonged its
powers it extended them considerably in order to meet the
pressing dangers which menaced the Republic. Though a
legislative assembly, it took over the executive power, entrusting
it to its own members. This &ldquo;confusion of powers,&rdquo; which was
contrary to the philosophical theories&mdash;those of Montesquieu
especially&mdash;which had inspired the Revolution at first, was
one of the essential characteristics of the Convention. The
series of exceptional measures by which that confusion of
powers was created constitutes the &ldquo;Revolutionary government&rdquo;
in the strict sense of the word, a government which was principally
in vigour during the period called &ldquo;the Terror.&rdquo; It is
thus necessary to distinguish, in the work of the Convention, the
temporary expedients from measures intended to be permanent.</p>

<p>The Convention held its first session in a hall of the Tuileries,
then it sat in the hall of <i>Manège</i>, and finally from the 10th of
May 1793 in that of the <i>Spectacles</i> (or <i>Machines</i>), an immense
hall in which the deputies were but loosely scattered. This
last hall had tribunes for the public, which often influenced the
debate by interruptions or applause. The full number of deputies
was 749, not counting 33 from the colonies, of whom only a
section arrived in Paris. Besides these, however, the departments
annexed from 1792 to 1795 were allowed to send deputations.
Many of the original deputies died or were exiled during
the Convention, but not all their places were filled by <i>suppléants</i>.
Some of those proscribed during the Terror returned after the
9th of Thermidor. Finally, many members were sent away
either to the departments or to the armies, on missions which
lasted sometimes for a considerable length of time. For all
these reasons it is difficult to find out the number of deputies
present at any given date, for votes by roll-call were rare. In
the Terror the number of those voting averaged only 250. The
members of the Convention were drawn from all classes of
society, but the most numerous were lawyers. Seventy-five
members had sat in the Constituent Assembly, 183 in the
Legislative.</p>

<p>According to its own ruling, the Convention elected its president
every fortnight. He was eligible for re-election after the
lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily the sessions were held in the
morning, but evening sessions were also frequent, often extending
late into the night. Sometimes in exceptional circumstances
the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat
for several days without interruption. For both legislative and
administrative purposes the Convention used committees, with
powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive
laws. The most famous of these committees are those of Public
Safety, of General Security, of Education (<i>Comité de salut public</i>,
<i>Comité de sûreté générale</i>, <i>Comité de l&rsquo;instruction</i>).</p>

<p>The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of
public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should
recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and
invasion, that it founded the system of public education (<i>Muséum</i>,
<i>École Polytechnique</i>, <i>École Normale Supérieure</i>, <i>École des Langues
orientales</i>, <i>Conservatoire</i>), created institutions of capital importance,
like that of the <i>Grand Livre de la Dette publique</i>,
and definitely established the social and political gains of the
Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONVERSION<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (Lat. <i>conversio</i>, from <i>convertere</i>, to turn or
change), a general term for the operation of converting, changing,
or transposing; used technically in special senses in logic,
theology and law.</p>

<p>1. <i>In logic,</i> conversion is one of three chief methods of immediate
inference by which a conclusion is obtained directly
from a single premise without the intervention of another
premise or middle term. A proposition is said to be &ldquo;converted&rdquo;
when the subject and the predicate change places; the original
proposition is the &ldquo;convertend,&rdquo; the new one the &ldquo;converse.&rdquo;
The chief rule governing conversion is that no term which was not
<i>distributed</i><a name="FnAnchor_1a" id="FnAnchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in the convertend may be distributed in the converse;
nor may the quality of the proposition (affirmative or
negative) be changed. It follows that of the four possible forms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
of propositions A, E, I and O (see article A), E and I can be
converted simply. If no A is B (E), it follows that no B is A;
if some A is B, it follows that some B is A. This form of conversion
is called Simple Conversion; E propositions convert into
E, and I into I. On the other hand, A cannot be converted
simply. If all men are mortal, the most that can follow by
conversion is that some mortals are men. This is called Conversion
by Limitation or <i>Per Accidens</i>. Only if it be known
from external or non-logical sources that the predicate also is
distributed can there be simple conversion of a universal affirmative.
Neither of these forms of conversion can be applied to
the particular negative proposition O, which has to be dealt
with under a secondary system of conversion, as follows. The
terminology by which these secondary processes are described
is not altogether satisfactory, and logicians are not agreed as to
the application of the terms. The following system is perhaps the
most commonly used. We have seen that the converse of &ldquo;all
A is B&rdquo; is &ldquo;some B is A&rdquo;; we can, in addition, derive from it
another, though purely formal, proposition &ldquo;no A is not-B&rdquo;;
<i>i.e.</i> an E proposition. This process is called Obversion, Permutation
or Immediate Inference by Privative Conception; it is
applicable to every proposition including O. A further process,
known as Contraposition or Conversion by Negation, consists
of conversion following on obversion. Thus from &ldquo;all A is B,&rdquo;
we get &ldquo;no not-B is A.&rdquo; In the case of the O proposition we
get (by obversion) &ldquo;some A is not-B&rdquo; and then (by conversion)
&ldquo;some not-B is A&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> an I proposition). In the case of the
I proposition the contrapositive is impossible, as infringing the
main rule of conversion. Another term, Inversion, has been
used by some logicians for a still more complicated process by
the alternative use of conversion and obversion, which is applicable
to A and E, and results in obtaining a proposition concerning
the contradictory of the original subject; thus &ldquo;all A is B&rdquo;
becomes &ldquo;some not-A is not B.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Considerable discussion has centred on the problem as to
whether the process of conversion can properly be regarded as
inference. The essence of inference is that the conclusion should
embody knowledge which is not in the premise or premises, and
many logicians have contended that no fact is stated in the
converse which was not in the convertend, or, in other words,
that conversion is merely a transformation or verbal change
of the same statement. Hence the term Eductions and Equivalent
Propositional Forms have been given to converse propositions.
It is clear, for instance, that if the universal affirmative
is taken connotatively as a scientific law, and not historically,
no real inference is achieved by stating as another scientific fact
its converse, the particular affirmative. Moreover, even if the
convertend is stated as an historic fact, though there is acquired
a certain new significance, it may well be argued that the
inference is not immediate but syllogistic.</p>

<p>2. <i>In theology</i>, conversion (the equivalent of the Gr. <span class="grk" title="strephein, epistrephein">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#941;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>) is originally the acceptation of Christianity by
heathens. It is also used generally for a change from one religion
to another, or in a narrower sense for a complete change
of attitude towards God, involving a deeper conviction of the
ultimate religious and moral truths. Considerable difference of
opinion has always existed, and still exists, within the Christian
Church as to the true nature and the causes of conversion,
especially in the sense last described. Some have held that man
is merely the passive recipient of the Divine Grace, a view based
largely on the rendering of the Authorized Version of Isaiah
vi. 10 as quoted in Matt. xiii. 15, Mark iv. 12, and John xii. 40.
Others again hold that baptism, as involving a second birth of
the baptized person, makes subsequent conversion unnecessary
or even meaningless, or conversely that conversion is this very
second birth and renders baptism unnecessary. The reply
generally made to such arguments is that baptism implies
regeneration only, which is a change wrought from the outside
by the Divine Spirit in general disposition or spiritual status,
while conversion is a positive or concrete demonstration of that
change, not merely the negative beginning of a new life but the
positive &ldquo;returning&rdquo; to God in faith and repentance. The
precise connexion between conversion and repentance is again
a vexed question. How far and in what sense does man take an
active part in his own conversion? To this it is frequently
answered that while the initial stage of conversion is and can be
the work of the Holy Spirit alone, it lies with man to make it
complete by accepting the proffered grace in repentance and faith
(cf. Acts vii. 51, &ldquo;Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and
ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost&rdquo;). A man may of his
own free will avoid those surroundings which predispose him to
such &ldquo;resistance.&rdquo; The view that man cannot convert himself
is clearly stated in Article X. by the Church of England. &ldquo;The
condition of man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot
turn (<i>sese convertere</i>) and prepare himself by his own natural
strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God: wherefore
we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable
to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us that
we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have
that good will.&rdquo; Further problems are connected with the
possibility of repeated conversions of the same man, the necessity
of a single strongly marked conversion completed in a single
process, the significance of sudden conversion of persons in a
highly emotional state, such as has been common in revivalist
meetings, especially in Wales and the United States of America.
Conversions of the last kind have followed frequently on striking
physical phenomena, perceived in many cases only by the convert
himself, such as a sudden bright light or a noise like a clap of
thunder.<a name="FnAnchor_2a" id="FnAnchor_2a" href="#Footnote_2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In all cases of conversion, however, the criterion of its
validity is generally taken to be the resultant change of a man&rsquo;s
character as manifested in his mode of life and thought, in the
abstention from sin, and in devotion to good works.</p>

<p>3. <i>In English law</i>, conversion is the unauthorized exercise
of dominion by one person over the property (other than money
or chattels real) of another, in a manner inconsistent with his
rights of possession, or the unauthorized assumption by another
of the powers of the true owner of goods. The history and
exact definition of this form of actionable wrong have occupied
the attention of many learned writers, and the incidents of
actions to assert the rights of the true owner form a considerable
part of treatises on the rules and forms of civil pleading. There
are many ways in which the wrong may be committed. In
some cases the exercise of the dominion may amount to an act
of trespass or to a crime, <i>e.g.</i> where the taking amounts to
larceny, or fraudulent appropriation by a bailee or agent entrusted
with the property of another (Larceny Acts of 1861 and
1901). But in such cases, except where money is taken, the
civil remedy of the owner is by action for conversion or detention
of the property, subject in the case of larceny to the rule that
criminal prosecution should precede restitution by the taker.
The remedy in use in these cases used to be by what was called
an action on the case for trover and conversion, the plaintiff
putting aside all suggestions of trespass and of crime, and resting
his case on the fiction that the defendant had found and used
goods not his own. The fictitious averment of loss was abolished
in 1852, and under the present procedure, in which the old forms
of action are not in use, the remedy is by a claim (still usually
called conversion) for wrongfully depriving the true owner of
personal property of its use by some specified act inconsistent
with his dominion over it, usually by dealing with the property
in a manner inconsistent with the owner&rsquo;s rights. Originally,
the action of trover and conversion was limited to goods and
chattels, but it is now accepted as applying to valuable securities,
such as cheques and bills of exchange.</p>

<p>The gist of the action is in the unauthorized dealing, for
however short a time and for however limited a purpose, with
the personal property of another. Even refusal to deliver up
to the owner is sufficient to prove conversion, though it is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
made the ground of an action for detinue, if the plaintiff desires
to have the property returned in specie. The knowledge, motive
or good faith of the person wrongfully dealing with the property
of another is for civil purposes immaterial, and the action is
often brought to try the title of two claimants to the same goods;
<i>e.g.</i> where a person who has innocently bought or taken in pledge
goods stolen or illegally procured resists the claim of the original
owner for the return of the goods. A warehouseman may
render himself liable to the owner of goods deposited with him,
through delivering the goods to a third person on a forged
authority or without authority, or by issuing a warehouse
receipt representing the goods to be in his possession or control
when they have ceased to be so.</p>

<p>The exact measure of compensation due to a plaintiff whose
goods have been wrongfully converted may be merely nominal
if the wrong is technical and the defendant can return the goods;
it may be limited to the actual damage where the goods can be
returned, but the wrong is substantial; but in ordinary cases
it is the full value to the owner of the goods of which he has
been deprived.</p>

<p>Fraudulent conversion by any person to his own use (or that
of persons other than the owner) of property entrusted to him
is a crime in the case of custodians of property, factors, trustees
under express trusts in writing (Larceny Act, 1861, ss. 77-85;
Larceny Act, 1901).</p>

<p>The law of Ireland, of most British possessions, and of the
United States, follows that of England as to the civil or criminal
remedies for conversion.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is also used in English law with reference
to the rule of courts of equity which, in certain cases (following
the maxim of treating as done what ought to have been done),
treats as converted into personalty land which has been directed
so to be converted by a will, contract or settlement, or as
converted into land personalty which has been by such instrument
directed to be applied for purchase of realty. The rule
is also applied where a vendor of land dies between the making
of the contract of sale and its completion by conveyance of the
land. The importance of the rule lies in the different destination
of realty and personalty under the laws relating to inheritance
and succession.</p>

<i>i.e.</i> to accompany, a meaning which still survived in the 18th

French form <i>conveier</i>, which in central France passed into the
form <i>convoier</i>, mod. Fr. <i>convoyer</i>, whence &ldquo;convoy.&rdquo; Apart
from the general sense given above the word conveyance is now
used in three special senses: (1) a carriage or other means of
transport, (2) in law, the transference of property by deed or
writing between living persons, and (3) the written instrument
by which such transference is effected. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conveyancing</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CONVEYANCING,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> in English law, the art or science of conveying
or effecting the transfer of property, or modifying interests
in relation to property, by means of written documents.</p>

<p>In early legal systems the main element in the transfer of
property was the change, generally accompanied by some public
ceremony, in the actual physical possession: the
function of documents, where used, being merely the
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
preservation of evidence. Thus, in Great Britain in the feudal
period, the common mode of conveying an immediate freehold
was by <i>feoffment with livery of seisin</i>&mdash;a proceeding in which the
transferee was publicly invested with the feudal possession or
<i>seisin</i>, usually through the medium of some symbolic act performed
in the presence of witnesses upon the land itself. A deed
or charter of feoffment was commonly executed at the same
time by way of record, but formed no essential part of the
conveyance. In the language of the old rule of the common law,
the immediate freehold in corporeal hereditaments lay in livery,
whereas reversions and remainders and all incorporeal hereditaments
lay in grant, <i>i.e.</i> passed by the delivery of the deed of
conveyance or grant without any further ceremony. The
process by which this distinction was broken down and the
present uniform system of private conveyancing by simple deed
was established, constitutes a long chapter in English legal
history.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The land of a feudal owner was subject to the risk of forfeiture
for treason, and to military and other burdens. The common law
did not allow him to dispose of it by will. By the law of mortmain
religious houses were prohibited from acquiring it. The
desire to escape from these burdens and limitations gave rise to the
practice of making feoffments to the <i>use</i> of, or upon trust for,
persons other than those to whom the seisin or legal possession
was delivered. The common law recognized only the legal tenant;
but the <i>cestui que use</i> or beneficial owner gradually secured for his
wishes and directions concerning the profits of the land the strong
protection of the chancellors as exercising the equitable jurisdiction
of the king. The resulting loss to the crown and the great lords of
the feudal dues and privileges, coupled with the public disadvantages
arising from ownership of land which, in an increasing degree, was
merely nominal, brought about the passing in the year 1535 of the
famous Statute of Uses, the object of which was to destroy altogether
the system of uses and equitable estates. It enacted, in
substance, that whoever should have a use or trust in any hereditaments
should be deemed to have the legal seisin, estate and possession
for the same interest that he had in the use; in other words, that
he should become in effect the feudal tenant without actual delivery
of possession to him by the actual feoffee to uses or trustee: In its
result the statute was a fiasco. It was solemnly decided that the act
transferred the legal possession to the use once only, and that in the
case of a conveyance to A to the use of B to the use of or upon trust
for C, it gave the legal estate to B, and left C with an interest in the
position of the use before the statute. Thus was completed the
foundation of the modern system of trusts fastened upon legal
estates and protected by the equitable doctrines and practice of the
judicature.</p>

<p>But the statute not only failed to abolish uses: it also opened
the way to the evasion of the public ceremony of livery of seisin, and
the avoidance of all notoriety in conveyances. Other ways, besides
an actual feoffment to uses, of creating a use had been in vogue before
the statute. If A bargained with B, in writing or not, for the sale
of land, and B paid the price, but A remained in legal possession,
the court of chancery enforced the use or equitable interest in favour
of B. The effect of a <i>bargain and sale</i> (as such a transaction was
called) after the statute was to give B the legal interest without any
livery of seisin. This fresh danger was met in the very year of the
statute itself by an enactment that a bargain and sale of an estate of
inheritance or freehold should be made by deed publicly enrolled.
But the Statute of Enrolments was in terms limited to estates of
freehold. It was allowed that a bargain and sale for a term, say, of
one year, must transfer the seisin to the bargainee without enrolment.
And since what remained in the bargainer was merely a
reversion which &ldquo;lay in grant,&rdquo; it was an easy matter to release this
by deed the day after. By this ingenious device was the publicity
of feoffment or enrolment avoided, and the <i>lease and release</i>, as the
process was called, remained the usual mode of conveying a freehold,
in <span class="correction" title="amended from posession">possession</span> down to the 19th century.</p>
</div>

<p>It was not until 1845 that the modern system of transfer by
a single deed was finally established. By the Real Property
Act of that year it was enacted that all corporeal hereditaments
should, as regards the immediate freehold, be deemed to lie in
grant as well as in livery. Since this act the ancient modes of
conveyance, though not abolished by it, have in practice become
obsolete. Traces of the old learning connected with them
remain, however, embedded in the modern conveyance. Many
a purchase-deed recites that the vendor is <i>seised</i> in fee-simple
of the property. It is the practice, moreover, to convey not only
&ldquo;to&rdquo; but also &ldquo;to the use of&rdquo; a purchaser. For before the
Statute of Uses, a conveyance made without any consideration
or declaration of uses was deemed to be made to the use of the
party conveying. In view of the operation of the statute upon
the legal estate in such circumstances, it is usual in all conveyances,
whether for value or not, to declare a use in favour of the
party to whom the grant is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
In its popular usage the word &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo; signifies the
document employed to carry out a purchase of land. But the
term &ldquo;conveyancing&rdquo; is of much wider import, and comprises
the preparation and completion of all kinds of legal instruments.
A well-known branch of the conveyancer&rsquo;s business is the investigation
of title&mdash;an important function in the case of purchases
or mortgages of real estate. With personal estate (other than
leasehold) he has perhaps not so much concern. Chattels are
usually transferred by delivery, and stocks or shares by means
of printed instruments which can be bought at a law-stationer&rsquo;s.
The common settlements and wills, however, deal wholly or
mainly with personal property; and an interest in settled
personalty is frequently the subject of a mortgage. Of late
years, also, there has been an enormous increase in the volume
of conveyancing business in connexion with limited joint-stock
companies.</p>

<p>In the preparation of legal documents the practitioner is
much assisted by the use of <i>precedents</i>. These are outlines or
models of instruments of all kinds, exhibiting in accepted legal
phraseology their usual form and contents with additions and
variations adapted to particular circumstances. Collections of
them have been in use from early times, certainly since printing
became common. The modern precedent is, upon the whole,
concise and businesslike. The prolixity which formerly characterized
most legal documents has largely disappeared, mainly
through the operation of statutes which enable many clauses
previously inserted at great length to be, in some cases, <i>e.g.</i>
covenants for title, incorporated by the use of a few prescribed
words, and in others safely omitted altogether. The Solicitors&rsquo;
Remuneration Act 1881, has also assisted the process of curtailment,
for there is now little or no connexion between the length
of a deed and the cost of its preparation. So long as the draftsman
adheres to recognized legal phraseology and to the well-settled
methods of carrying out legal operations, there is no reason
why modern instruments should not be made as terse and
businesslike as possible.</p>

<p>It is not usual for land to be sold without a formal agreement
in writing being entered into. This precaution is due, partly
to the Statute of Frauds (§ 4), which renders a contract
for the sale of land unenforceable by action &ldquo;unless
<span class="sidenote">Contracts for sale.</span>
the agreement upon which such action shall be brought,
or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other
person thereunto by him lawfully authorized,&rdquo; and partly to the
fact that there are few titles which can with prudence be exposed
to all the requisitions that a purchaser under an &ldquo;open contract&rdquo;
is entitled by law to make. Such a purchaser may, for example,
require a forty years&rsquo; title (Vendor and Purchaser Act 1874).
Under an open contract a vendor is presumed to be selling the
fee-simple in possession, free from any incumbrance, or liability,
or restriction as to user or otherwise; and if he cannot deduce a
title of the statutory length, or procure an incumbrance or
restriction to be removed, the purchaser may repudiate the
contract. The preparation of an agreement for sale involves
accordingly an examination of the vendor&rsquo;s title, and the exercise
of skill and judgment in deciding how the vendor may be protected
against trouble and expense without prejudice to the
sale. Upon a sale by auction the agreement is made up of (1)
the particulars, which describe the property; (2) the conditions
of sale, which state the terms upon which it is offered; and
(3) the memorandum or formal contract at the foot of the conditions,
which incorporates by reference the particulars and
conditions, names or sufficiently refers to the vendor, and is
signed by the purchaser after the sale. The object of the agreement,
whether the sale is by private contract or by auction, is
to define accurately what is sold, to provide for the length of
title and the evidence in support of or in connexion with the
title which is to be required except so far as it is intended that
the general law shall regulate the rights of the parties, and to
fix the times at which the principal steps in the transaction are
to be taken. It is also usual to provide for the payment of interest
at a prescribed rate upon the purchase money if the completion
shall be delayed beyond the day fixed for any cause other than
the vendor&rsquo;s wilful default, and also that the vendor shall be at
liberty to rescind the contract without paying costs or compensation
if the purchaser insists upon any requisition or objection
which the vendor is unable or, upon the ground of expense or
other reasonable ground, is unwilling to comply with or remove.
Upon a sale by auction it is the rule to require a deposit to be
paid by way of security to the vendor against default on the
part of the purchaser.</p>

<p>The signature of the agreement is followed by the delivery
to the purchaser or his solicitor of the abstract of title, which
is an epitome of the various instruments and events
under and in consequence of which the vendor derives
<span class="sidenote">Abstract of title.</span>
his title. A purchaser is entitled to an abstract at
the vendor&rsquo;s expense unless otherwise stipulated. It begins
with the instrument fixed by the contract for the commencement
of the title, or, if there has been no agreement upon the subject,
with an instrument of such character and date as is prescribed
by the law in the absence of stipulation between the parties.
From its commencement as so determined the abstract, if properly
prepared, shows the history of the title down to the sale; every
instrument, marriage, birth, death, or other fact or event constituting
a link in the chain of title, being sufficiently set forth
in its proper order. The next step is the verification of the
abstract on the purchaser&rsquo;s behalf by a comparison of it with
the originals of the deeds, the probates of the wills, and office
copies of the instruments of record through which the title is
traced. The vendor is bound to produce the original documents,
except such as are of record or have been lost or destroyed, but,
unless otherwise stipulated, the expense of producing those
which are not in his possession falls upon the purchaser (Conveyancing
Act 1881). After being thus verified, the abstract
is perused by the purchaser&rsquo;s advisers with the object of seeing
whether a title to the property sold is deduced according to the
contract, and what evidence, information or objection, in respect
of matters appearing or arising upon the abstract, ought to be
called for or taken. For this purpose it is necessary to consider
the legal effect of the abstracted instruments, whether they
have been properly completed, whether incumbrances, adverse
interests, defects, liabilities in respect of duties, or any other
burdens or restrictions disclosed by the abstract, have been
already got rid of or satisfied, or remain to be dealt with before
the completion of the sale. The result of the consideration of these
<span class="sidenote">Requisitions.</span>
matters is embodied in &ldquo;requisitions upon title,&rdquo; which
are delivered to the vendor&rsquo;s solicitors within a time
usually fixed for the purpose by the contract. In making
or insisting upon requisitions regard is had, among other things,
to any special conditions in the contract dealing with points as to
which evidence or objection might otherwise have been required
or taken, and to a variety of provisions contained in the Vendor
and Purchaser Act 1874, and the Conveyancing Act 1881, which
apply, except so far as otherwise agreed, and of which the following
are the most important: (1) Recitals, statements and
descriptions of facts, matters and parties contained in instruments
twenty years old at the date of the contract are, unless proved
inaccurate, to be taken as sufficient evidence of the truth of such
facts, matters and descriptions; (2) a purchaser cannot require
the production of, or make any requisition or objection in respect
of, any document dated before the commencement of the title;
(3) the cost of obtaining evidence and information not in the
vendor&rsquo;s possession must be borne by the purchaser. The
possibility of the rescission clause now commonly found in contracts
for the sale of real estate being exercised in order to avoid
compliance with an onerous requisition, is also an important
factor in the situation. The requisitions are in due course
replied to, and further requisitions may arise out of the answers.
A summary method of obtaining a judicial determination of
questions connected with the contract, but not affecting its
validity, is provided by the Vendor and Purchaser Act 1874.
Before completion it is usual for the purchaser to cause searches
to be made in various official registers for matters required to
be entered therein, such as judgments, land charges, and pending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
actions, which may affect the vendor&rsquo;s title to sell, or amount
to an incumbrance upon the property.</p>

<p>When the title has been approved, or so soon as it appears
reasonably certain that it will be accepted, the draft conveyance
is prepared and submitted to the vendor. This is
commonly done by and at the expense of the purchaser,
<span class="sidenote">Conveyances.</span>
who is entitled to determine the form of the conveyance,
provided that the vendor is not thereby prejudiced,
or put to additional expense. The common mode of conveying
a freehold is now, as already mentioned, by ordinary deed,
called in this case an <i>indenture</i>, from the old practice, where a
deed was made between two or more parties, of writing copies
upon the same parchment and then dividing it by an indented
or toothed line. Indenting is, however, not necessary, and in
modern practice is disused. A deed derives its efficacy from
its being sealed and delivered. It is still a matter of doubt
whether signing is essential. It is not necessary that its execution
should be attested except in special circumstances, as, <i>e.g.</i>
where made under a power requiring the instrument exercising
it to be attested. But in practice conveyances are not only
sealed, but also signed, and attested by one or two witnesses.
The details of a conveyance in any particular case depend upon
the subject-matter and terms of the sale, and the state of the
title as appearing by the abstract. The framework, however,
of an ordinary purchase-deed consists of (1) the date and parties,
(2) the recitals, (3) the testatum or witnessing-part, containing
the statement of the consideration for the sale, the words
incorporating covenants for title and the operative words, (4)
the parcels or description of the property, (5) the habendum,
showing the estate or interest to be taken by the purchaser, and
(6) any provisos or covenants that may be required. A few
words will illustrate the object and effect of these component
parts.</p>

<p>(1) The parties are the persons from whom the property, or
some estate or interest in or in relation to it, is to pass to the
purchaser, or whose concurrence is rendered necessary by the
state of the title in order to give the purchaser the full benefit
of his contract and to complete it according to law. It is often
necessary that other persons besides the actual vendor should
join in the conveyance, <i>e.g.</i> a mortgagee who is to be paid off
and convey his estate, a trustee of an outstanding legal estate,
a person entitled to some charge or restriction who is to release
it, or trustees who are to receive the purchase-money where a
limited owner is selling under a power (<i>e.g.</i> a tenant for life
under the power given by the Settled Land Act 1882). Parties
are described by their names, addresses and occupations or
titles, each person with a separate interest, or filling a distinct
character, being of a separate part. (2) The recitals explain
the circumstances of the title, the interests of the parties in
relation to the property, and the agreement or object intended
to be carried into effect by the conveyance. Where the sale is
by an absolute owner there is no need for recitals, and they are
frequently dispensed with; but where there are several parties
occupying different positions, recitals in chronological order of
the instruments and facts giving rise to their connexion with
the property are generally necessary in order to make the deed
intelligible. (3) It is usual to mention the consideration. Where
it consists of money the statement of its payment is followed
by an acknowledgment, in a parenthesis, of its receipt, which,
in deeds executed since the Conveyancing Act 1881, dispenses
with any endorsed or further receipt. A vendor, who is the
absolute beneficial owner, now conveys expressly &ldquo;as beneficial
owner,&rdquo; which words, by virtue of the Conveyancing Act 1881,
imply covenants by him with the purchaser that he has a right
to convey, for quiet enjoyment, freedom from incumbrances,
and for further assurance&mdash;limited, however, to the acts and
defaults of the covenantor and those through whom he derives
his title otherwise than by purchase for value. A trustee or an
incumbrancer joining in the deed conveys &ldquo;as trustee&rdquo; or &ldquo;as
mortgagee,&rdquo; by which words covenants are implied that the
covenantor individually has not done or suffered anything to
incumber the property, or prevent him from conveying as
expressed. As to the operative words, any expression showing
an intention to pass the estate is effectual. Since the Conveyancing
Act 1881, &ldquo;convey&rdquo; has become as common as &ldquo;grant,&rdquo;
which was formerly used. (4) The property may be described
either in the body of the deed or in a schedule, or compendiously
in the one and in detail in the other. In any case it is usual to
annex a plan. Different kinds of property have their appropriate
technical words of description. <i>Hereditaments</i> is the most
comprehensive term, and is generally used either alone or in
conjunction with other words more specifically descriptive of
the property conveyed. (5) The habendum begins with the
words &ldquo;to hold,&rdquo; and the estate, on a sale in fee-simple, is
limited, as already mentioned, not only <i>to</i>, but also <i>to the use of</i>,
the purchaser. Before the Conveyancing Act 1881, it was
necessary to add, after the name of the purchaser, the words
&ldquo;and his heirs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;his heir and assigns,&rdquo; though the word
&ldquo;assigns&rdquo; never had any conveyancing force. But since that
Act it is sufficient to add &ldquo;in fee-simple&rdquo; without using the
word &ldquo;heirs.&rdquo; Unless, however, one or other of these additions
is made, the purchaser will even now get only an estate for his
life. If the property is to be held subject to a lease or incumbrance,
or is released by the deed from an incumbrance previously
existing, this is expressed after the words of limitation. (6)
Where any special covenants or provisions have been stipulated
for, or are required in the circumstances of the title, they are,
as a rule, inserted at the end of the conveyance. In simple
cases none are needed. Where, however, a vendor retains
documents of title, which he is entitled to do where he sells a
part only of the estate to which they relate, it is the practice
for him by the conveyance to acknowledge the right of the
purchaser to production and delivery of copies of such of them
as are not instruments of record like wills or orders of court, and
to undertake for their safe custody. This acknowledgment and
undertaking supply the place of the lengthy covenants to the
like effect which were usual before the Conveyancing Act 1881.
A trustee or mortgagee joining gives an acknowledgment as to
documents retained by him, but not an undertaking. The foregoing
outline of a conveyance will be illustrated by the following
specimen of a simple purchase-deed of part of an estate belonging
to an absolute owner in fee:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">This Indenture</span> made the&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;day of&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
between A. B. of, &amp;c., of the one part and C. D. of, &amp;c., of the other
part <span class="sc">Whereas</span> the said A. B. is seised (among other hereditaments)
of the messuage hereinafter described and hereby conveyed for an
estate in fee simple in possession free from incumbrances and has
agreed to sell the same to the said C. D. for £100 <span class="sc">Now this Indenture
witnesseth</span> that in pursuance of the said agreement
and in consideration of the sum of £100 paid to the said A. B. by
the said C. D. (the receipt whereof the said A. B. doth hereby acknowledge)
the said A. B. as beneficial owner doth hereby convey unto
the said C. D. <span class="sc">All that</span> messuage or tenement situate &amp;c., and
known as, &amp;c. <span class="sc">To Hold</span> the premises unto and to the use of the said
C. D. his heirs and assigns [<i>or</i> in fee simple] And the said A. B.
doth hereby acknowledge the right of the said C. D. to production
and delivery of copies of the following documents of title [<i>mentioning
them</i>] and doth undertake for the safe custody thereof <span class="sc">In
witness</span>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that throughout the deed there are no stops,
the commencement of the several parts being indicated by capital
letters. The draft conveyance having been approved on behalf of
the vendor, it is engrossed upon stout paper or parchment, and
there remains only the completion of the sale, which usually
takes place at the office of the vendor&rsquo;s solicitor. A purchaser is
not entitled to require the vendor to attend personally and
execute the conveyance in his presence or that of his solicitor.
The practice is for the deed to be previously executed by the
vendor and delivered to his solicitor, and for the solicitor to
receive the purchase-money on his client&rsquo;s behalf, since a
purchaser is, under the Conveyancing Act 1881, safe in paying the
purchase-money to a solicitor producing a deed so executed, when
it contains the usual acknowledgment by the vendor of the
receipt of the money. Upon the completion, the documents of
title are handed over except in the case above referred to, and any
claims between the parties in respect of interest upon the
purchase-money, apportioned outgoings, or otherwise, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
settled. The conveyance is, of course, delivered to the purchaser,
upon whom rests the obligation of affixing the proper stamp&mdash;which
he may do without penalty within thirty days after
execution (Stamp Act 1891). It may be added that, subject to
any special bargain, which is rarely made, the costs of the
execution by the vendor and other parties whose concurrence is
necessary, and of any act required to be done by the vendor to
carry out his contract, are borne by the vendor.</p>

<p>Ordinary leases at rack-rents are not generally preceded by a
formal agreement, such as is common on a sale of land, or by an
investigation into the lessor&rsquo;s title. As a rule, the
principal terms are arranged between the parties, and
<span class="sidenote">Leases.</span>
embodied with various ancillary provisions in a draft lease,
which is prepared by the lessor&rsquo;s advisers and submitted to the
lessee, the ultimate form and contents of the instrument being
adjusted by negotiation. If an intending lessee desires to
examine the title he must make an express bargain to that effect,
for under a contract to grant a lease the intended lessee is not
entitled, in the absence of such express stipulation, to call for the
title to the freehold (Vendor and Purchaser Act 1874). By the
Statute of Frauds all leases, except leases for a term not exceeding
three years, and at not less than two-thirds of the rack-rent, were
required to be in writing. And now by the Real Property Act
1845, leases required by law to be in writing are void <i>at law</i> unless
made by deed. An instrument, void as a lease under the act,
may, however, be valid as an agreement to take a lease; and
since the Judicature Act 1873, under which equitable doctrines
prevail in the High Court, a person holding under an agreement
for a lease, of which specific performance would be granted, is
treated in all branches of that court as if such a lease were
already executed. Unless otherwise agreed, a lease is always
prepared by a lessor&rsquo;s solicitor at the expense of the lessee; but
the cost of the counterpart (<i>i.e.</i> the duplicate executed by the
lessee) is usually borne by the lessor.</p>

<p>Upon the sale and conveyance of a leasehold property substantially
the same procedure is observed as above indicated in
the case of a freehold. A few additional points,
however, may be specially mentioned. Under an open
<span class="sidenote">Assignment of leaseholds.</span>
contract the vendor cannot be called upon to show the
title to the freehold reversion (Vendor and Purchaser
Act 1874; Conveyancing Act 1881). Accordingly, the abstract
of title begins with the lease, however old; but the subsequent
title need not be carried back for more than forty years before the
sale. The purchaser, apart from stipulation, must assume,
unless the contrary appears, that the lease was duly granted, and
upon production of the receipt for the last payment due for rent
before completion, that all the covenants and provisions of the
lease have been duly performed and observed up to the date of
actual completion. The appropriate word of conveyance is
&ldquo;assign,&rdquo; and a conveyance of leaseholds is generally called an
assignment. The vendor&rsquo;s covenants for title implied by his
assigning &ldquo;as beneficial owner&rdquo; include, in addition to the
covenants implied by those words in a conveyance of freehold, a
covenant limited in manner above mentioned, that the lease is
valid, and that the rent and the provisions of the lease have been
paid and observed up to the time of conveyance (Conveyancing
Act 1881). Where the vendor, as is the common case, remains
liable after the assignment for the rent and the performance of
the covenants, the purchaser must covenant to pay the rent, and
perform and observe the covenants and provisions of the lease,
and keep the vendor indemnified in those respects.</p>

<p>A mortgage is prepared by the solicitor of the mortgagee, and
the mortgagor bears the whole expenses of the transaction. It is
seldom that there is any preliminary agreement,
because (1) a contract to lend money is not specifically
<span class="sidenote">Mortgages.</span>
enforceable; and (2) inasmuch as the primary object of a
mortgagee is to have his money well secured, he is not, generally,
willing to submit to restrictions as to title or evidence of title
which might give rise to difficulty or expense in the event of a
sale of the mortgaged property. An intending mortgagor is
accordingly required to show a title easily marketable, and to
verify it at his own cost. A mortgage follows the same general
form as a conveyance on sale, the principal points of difference
being that the conveyance of the property is preceded by a
covenant for the payment of the mortgage money and interest,
and followed by a proviso for reconveyance upon such payment,
and by any special provisions necessary or proper in the circumstances,
such as a covenant for insurance and repairs where the
security comprises buildings. The covenants for title implied by
a mortgagor conveying &ldquo;as beneficial owner&rdquo; are the same as in
the case of a vendor, but they are absolute and not qualified in
the manner above pointed out.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The beneficial operation of the Conveyancing Act 1881 in shortening
conveyances is well illustrated by a modern mortgage. For, by
virtue of the act, a mortgagee by deed executed after its commencement
has, subject to any contrary provisions contained in the deed,
the following powers to the like extent as if they had been conferred
in terms: (1) a power of sale exercisable after the mortgage money
has become due (a) if notice requiring payment has been served
and not complied with for three months, (b) if any interest is in
arrear for two months, or (c) there has been a breach of some
obligation under the deed or the act other than the covenant for
payment of the mortgage money or interest; (2) a power to insure
subject to certain restrictions; (3) a power, when entitled to sell,
to appoint a receiver; and (4) a power while in possession to cut
and sell timber. The act contains ancillary provisions enabling
a mortgagee upon a sale to convey the property for such estate or
interest as is the subject of the mortgage, and to give a valid receipt
for the purchase-money, and the purchaser is amply protected
against any irregularities of which he had no notice. There are also
large powers of leasing conferred by the act upon mortgagor and
mortgagee while respectively in possession, and a power for the
mortgagor, whilst entitled to redeem, to inspect and take copies of
title-deeds in the mortgagee&rsquo;s possession. The elaborate provisions
for all these purposes which were formerly inserted in mortgage
deeds are now omitted; but sometimes the operation of the act is
modified in certain respects. The procedure upon a sale by a mortgagee
is the same as in the case of any other vendor. He conveys,
however, &ldquo;as mortgagee,&rdquo; these words implying only a covenant
by him against incumbrances arising from his own acts.</p>
</div>

<p>The frame of a strict settlement of real estate, which is usually
made either on marriage or by way of resettlement on a tenant in
tail under an existing settlement attaining twenty-one,
has been much simplified; but such settlements still
<span class="sidenote">Settlements.</span>
remain the most technical and most complicated of
legal instruments. By virtue of the Settled Land Acts 1882 to
1890, tenants for life and many other limited owners have
extensive powers of sale, of leasing, and of doing numerous other
acts required in a due course of management. These powers
cannot be excluded or fettered by settlors. They are, as a rule,
considered in practice to be sufficient, and the corresponding
elaborate provisions formerly inserted in settlements are now
omitted, the operation of the acts being merely supplemented,
where desirable, by some extension of the statutory powers, in
relation, <i>e.g.</i>, to the investment and application of capital money.
To complete the statutory machinery it is desirable that persons
should be nominated by the settlement trustees for the purposes
of the acts. Since the Conveyancing Act 1881, provisions for the
protection of jointresses or persons entitled under settlements to
rent charges or annual sums issuing out of the land are no longer
required, as all such persons have now powers of distress and
entry, and of limiting terms to secure their respective interests.
Terms for raising portions must still, however, be expressly
created. The Conveyancing Act 1881 also confers large powers
of management during the minorities of infants beneficially
entitled upon persons either appointed for the purpose by the
instrument or being such trustees such as are mentioned in § 42.
An estate in tail may now be limited by the use of the words &ldquo;in
tail&rdquo; without the words &ldquo;heirs of the body&rdquo; formerly necessary.
And a settlor generally conveys &ldquo;as settlor,&rdquo; by which only a
covenant for further assurance is implied under the Conveyancing
Act 1881. Personal settlements are most often made upon
marriage. The settled property is vested in trustees, either by
the settlement itself, or in the case of cash, mortgage debts, stocks
or shares, by previous delivery or transfer, upon trusts declared
by the instrument.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The normal trusts after the marriage are (1) for investment;
(2) for payment of the income of the husband&rsquo;s property to him
for life, and of the wife&rsquo;s property to her for life for her separate
use without power of anticipation whilst under coverture; (3) for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
payment to the survivor for his or her life of the income of both
properties; (4) after the death of the survivor, both as to capital
and income, for the issue of the marriage as the husband and wife
shall jointly by deed appoint, and in default of joint appointment
as the survivor shall by deed or will appoint, and in default of such
appointment for the children of the marriage who attain twenty-one,
or being daughters marry, in equal shares, with the addition
of a clause (called the hotchpot clause) precluding a child who
or whose issue takes a part of the fund by appointment from sharing
in the unappointed part without bringing the appointed share into
account. Then follows a power for the trustees with the consent
of the parents whilst respectively living to raise a part (usually a
half) of the share of a child and apply it for his or her advancement
or benefit. Power to apply income, after the death of the life tenants,
for the maintenance and education of infants entitled in expectancy,
is conferred upon trustees by the Conveyancing Act 1881. The
ultimate trusts in the event of there being no children who attain
vested interests are (1) of the husband&rsquo;s property for him absolutely;
and (2) of the wife&rsquo;s property for such persons as she shall when
discovert by deed, or whether covert or discovert by will, appoint,
and in default of appointment, for her absolutely if she survive the
husband, but if not, then for her next of kin under the Statute of
Distributions, excluding the husband. For all ordinary purposes
the trustees have now under various statutes sufficient powers and
indemnities. They may, however, in some cases need special protection
against liability. A power of appointing new trustees is
supplied by the Trustee Act 1893. It is usually made exercisable
by the husband and wife during their joint lives, and by the survivor
during his or her life.</p>
</div>

<p>The form and contents of wills are extremely diverse. A will
of, perhaps, the commonest type (a) appoints executors and
trustees; (b) makes a specific disposition of a freehold
or leasehold residence; (c) gives a few legacies or
<span class="sidenote">Wills.</span>
annuities; and (d) devises and bequeaths to the executors and
trustees the residue of the real and personal estate upon trust
to sell and convert, to invest the proceeds (after payment of
debts and funeral and testamentary expenses) in a specified
manner, to pay the income of the investments to the testator&rsquo;s
widow for life or until another marriage, and subject to her
interest, to hold the capital and income in trust for his children
who attain twenty-one, or being daughters marry, in equal
shares, with a power of advancement. Daughters&rsquo; shares are
frequently settled by testators upon them and their issue on
the same lines and with the same statutory incidents as above
mentioned in the observations upon settlements; and sometimes
a will contains in like manner a strict settlement of real
estate. It is a point often overlooked by testators desirous of
benefiting remote descendants that future interests in property
must, under what is known as the rule against perpetuities, be
restricted within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years
afterwards. In disposing of real estate &ldquo;devise&rdquo; is the appropriate
word of conveyance, and of personal estate &ldquo;bequeath.&rdquo;
But neither word is at all necessary. &ldquo;I leave all I have to
A. B. and appoint him my executor&rdquo; would make an effectual will
for a testator who wished to give all his property, whether real
or personal, after payment of his debts, to a single person.
By virtue of the Land Transfer Act 1897, Part I., real estate of
an owner dying after 1897 now vests for administrative purposes
in his executors or administrators, notwithstanding any testamentary
disposition.</p>

<p>It remains to mention that by the Land Transfer Act 1897 a
system of compulsory registration of title, limited to the county
of London, was established. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Land Registration</a></span>.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Conveyancing counsel to the court</i> (<i>i.e.</i> to the chancery division
of the High Court) are certain counsel, in actual practice as conveyancers,
of not less than ten years&rsquo; standing, who are appointed
by the lord chancellor, to the number of six, under s. 40 of the
Master in Chancery Abolition Act 1852. They are appointed for the
purpose of assisting the court in the investigation of the title to any
estate, and upon their opinion the court or any judge thereof may
act. Any party who objects to the opinion given by any conveyancing
counsel may have the point in dispute disposed of by
the judge at chambers or in court. Business to be referred to
conveyancing counsel is distributed among them in rotation, and
their fees are regulated by the taxing officers.</p>
</div>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;American legislation favours the general
policy of registering all documents in the contents of which the
public have an interest, and its tendency has been steadily
towards more and more full registration both of documents and
statistics. From the early days of the colonial era it has been
customary to record wills and conveyances of real estate in full
in public books, suitably indexed, to which free access was given.
During the last decade of the 19th century, three states&mdash;Illinois,
Massachusetts, and Ohio&mdash;adopted the main features
of the Torrens or Prussian system for registering title to land
rather than conveyances under which title may be claimed.
These are the ascertainment by public officers of the state of the
title to some or all of the parcels of real estate which are the
subject of individual property within the state; the description
of each parcel (giving its proper boundaries and characteristics)
on a separate page of a public register, and of the manner in
which the title is vested; the issue of a certificate to the owner
that he is the owner; the official notation on this register of
each change of title thereafter; and a warranty by the government
of the title to which it may have certified. To make the
system complete it is further requisite that every landowner
should be compelled to make use of it, and that it should be
impossible to transfer a title effectually without the issue of
such a government certificate in favour of the purchaser.</p>

<p>Constitutional provisions have been found to prevent or
embarrass legislation in these directions in some of the states,
but it is believed that they are nowhere such as cannot be obeyed
without any serious encroachment on the principles of the new
system (<i>People</i> v. <i>Chase</i>, 165 Illinois Reports, 527; <i>State</i> v.
<i>Guilbert</i>, 56 Ohio State Reports, 575; <i>People</i> v. <i>Simon</i>, 176
Illinois Reports, 165; <i>Tyler</i> v. <i>Judges</i>, 173 Massachusetts
Reports; 55 North-Eastern Reporter, 812; <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,
161 United States Reports, 256).</p>

<p>Conveyances which have been duly recorded become of comparatively
little importance in the United States. The party
claiming immediately under them, if forced to sue to vindicate
his title, must produce them or account for their loss; but any
one deriving title from him can procure a certified copy of the
original conveyance from the recording officer and rely on that.
Equitable mortgages by a deposit of title-deeds are unknown.</p>

<p>The general prevalence of public registry systems has had an
influence in the development of American jurisprudence in the
direction of supporting provisions in wills and conveyances, which,
unless generally known, might tend to mislead and deceive, such as
spendthrift trusts (<i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Eaton</i>, 91 United States Reports, 716).</p>

<p>Conveyances of real estate are simple in form, and are
often prepared by those who have had no professional training
for the purpose. Printed blanks, sold at the law-stationers,
are commonly employed. The lawyers in each state have
devised forms for such blanks, sometimes peculiar in some
points to the particular state, and sometimes copied verbatim
from those in use elsewhere. Deeds intended to convey an
absolute estate are generally either of the form known as
<i>warranty deed</i> or of that known as <i>release deed</i>. The release deed
is often used as a primary conveyance without warranty to one
who has no prior interest in the land. Uniformity in deeds is
rendered particularly desirable from the general prevalence of
the system of recording all conveyances at length in a public
office. Record books are printed for this purpose, containing
printed pages corresponding to the printed blanks in use in the
particular state, and the recording officer simply has to fill up
each page as the deed of similar form was filled up. One set of
books may thus be kept for recording warranty deeds, another
for recording release deeds, another for recording mortgage
deeds, another for leases, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONVEYORS.<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> &ldquo;Conveyor&rdquo; (for derivation see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conveyance</a></span>)
is a term generally applied to mechanical devices designed for
the purpose of moving material in a horizontal or slightly inclined
direction; in this article, however, are included a variety
of appliances for moving materials in horizontal, vertical and
combined horizontal and vertical directions. The material so
handled may be conveyed in a practically uninterrupted stream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
as in the case of worms, bands and pushplate conveyors, or
elevators carrying grain or coal, &amp;c.; or it may be conveyed
from one point to another, intermittently, that is to say in a
succession of separate loads, as happens with single bucket
elevators, furnace hoists, rope and chain haulage, and also in
the case of ropeways and aerial cableways. Some of these
devices are of great antiquity, others are of quite modern origin.
The principles of their construction are simple and easy of
understanding, but by variations in the details of their construction
the engineer has adapted these few appliances to the most
varied work. At one end of the scale they may be used for
such light duties as conveying the goods purchased by a customer
to the packers and bringing them back made up into a parcel
or for taking his money to the cashier and returning the change.
At the other they are adopted for handling large quantities of
heavy material at a minimum expenditure of human labour.
Coal, for instance, a more or less friable substance, the value of
which is seriously diminished by fracture, may be mechanically
handled with a minimum risk of breakage. The difficult problem
of handling the contents of gas retorts and coke ovens, and of
simultaneously quenching and conveying the glowing material,
has been solved. Perhaps an even more astonishing piece of
work is the manipulation of the iron from the blast furnace;
for instance, liquid metal is drawn from a furnace into pouring
pots which in their turn discharge it to and distribute it over a
pig-iron casting machine, which is practically a conveyor for
liquid metal, consisting of a strand of moving moulds from which
the solidified pigs, after cooling in water, are automatically
removed after reaching the loading terminal over the railway
trucks. Certain types of conveyors may be made to combine
efficiently, with their primary work of transport, complex
sorting, sifting, drying and weighing operations.</p>

<p><i>Worm Conveyors.</i>&mdash;The worm conveyor, also known as the
Archimedean screw, is doubtless the most ancient form of
conveyor. It consists of a continuous or broken blade screw
set on a spindle. This spindle is made to revolve in a suitable
trough, and as it revolves any material put in is propelled by the
screw from one end of the trough to the other. Such conveyors
have been used in flour-mills for centuries. The writer has seen
in an East Anglian mill which was over 250 years old disused
screw conveyors, probably as old as the mill, consisting of
spindles of octagonal shape, made of not too hard wood, around
which a broken blade screw was formed by the insertion at
regular intervals of small blades of hard wood (fig. 1). Modern
worm conveyors usually consist of a spindle formed of a length of
wrought iron piping, to which is fitted either a broken or continuous
worm. In the former case (fig. 2) the worm is composed
of a series of blades or paddles arranged like a spiral round the
spindle; each blade is fixed, by means of its shank, in a transverse
hole in the spindle, and the shank is held in position by being
tapped and fitted with a nut. In this way is formed, out of
separate blades, a practically complete screw, technically known
as a &ldquo;paddle worm.&rdquo; The lengths or sections of the worm
run to about 8 ft., the various lengths being coupled by turned
gudgeons, which also serve as journals for the bearings. In the
so-called continuous worm conveyors the screw is formed of a
continuous sheet-iron spiral (fig. 3). Sometimes a narrow groove
is cut in spiral form on the spindle, and in this groove the sheet-iron
spiral is secured.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Spiral or Anti-Friction Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<p>The <i>spiral</i> or <i>anti-friction</i> conveyor (fig. 4) was introduced
about 1887. In this case a narrow spiral, which passes concentrically
round the spindle, with a space between both, is fixed
to it at set intervals by small blades, each of which is itself fixed
by its shank and a nut to the spindle. The spiral may be made of
almost any section, from a round bar about ½ in. in diameter to
L or T section, but is preferably a flat bar. Worms are fitted into
wooden or iron troughs leaving a clearance of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> in. The
spindle must be supported at suitable intervals by bearings,
preferably of the bush type. A continuous worm, being more
rigid than a paddle worm, needs fewer supports. The lid of the
worm trough should be loose, not screwed on, because in case of
an accumulation of feed through a choke in a delivery spout the
paddles of a paddle worm would be broken, or a continuous worm
stripped, unless the material could throw off the lid and relieve
the worm. The ratios of the pitch of the worm to the diameter
must be regulated by the nature of the material to be conveyed,
and will vary from one-third to a pitch equal to, or even exceeding,
the diameter. The greater the pitch the larger the capacity, but
also the greater the driving power required, at the same speed.
For handling materials of greater specific gravity, such as
cement, &amp;c., it is advisable to use a smaller pitch than for
substances of lower specific gravity, such as grain. The capacity
of a continuous worm exceeds that of either a paddle or spiral
conveyor of the same diameter, pitch and speed. As regards the
relative efficiency of paddle and spiral conveyors a series of
careful tests made by the writer indicated that, run at a slow
speed the paddle worm, but at a high speed the spiral worm, has
the greater efficiency. There is of course a speed at which the
efficiency of both types is about equal, and that is at 150 revolutions
per minute for conveyors 4 to 6 in. in diameter.</p>

<p>The power necessary to drive worm conveyors under normal
conditions is very considerable; a continuous worm of 18 to 20 in.
diameter running at 60 revolutions per minute will convey 50
tons of grain per hour over a distance of a hundred feet at an
expenditure of 18½ to 19 H.P. A material like cement would
require rather more power because of the greater friction of the
cement against the blades and the trough. Delivery from a
worm conveyor can be effected at any desired point, all that is
necessary being to cut an outlet, which should preferably be as
wide as the diameter of the worm, because the worm delivers only
on its leading side, and is practically empty on the other side,
so that a smaller outlet might only give exit to a portion of the
feed, unless it was on the leading side.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Tubular Worm Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<p>A special form of worm conveyor is the <i>tubular</i> (fig. 5), which
consists of an iron tube with a continuous spiral fitted to its inner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
periphery, or of iron or wooden tubes of square sections fitted
with fixed baffle plates inside. In working it revolves bodily on
suitable rollers. This type is more costly than the ordinary
worm conveyors, and also requires more power. Its efficiency is,
moreover, easily impaired if run at too high a speed, because
the centrifugal force asserts itself and counteracts the propulsion,
which in this case is effected by gravity. Some experiments
made in 1868 by George Fosbery Lyster, engineer of the Liverpool
docks, gave convincing results (see <i>Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.</i>,
August 1869). The tubular worm conveyor is suitable where a
granular material has to be moved over a comparatively short
distance, say from one building to another on the same level, and
where no bridge is available for the installation of any other kind
of conveyor. Conveyors of this type have, however, come into
use for conveying hard and cutting substances over considerable
lengths. Ordinary worm conveyors are practically debarred
from use for such substances on account of the short life of the
intermediate bearings, which are not necessary with externally
supported tubular worms.</p>

<p>To sum up, worm conveyors are of the simplest construction
and of small prime cost. The terminals again are much less
expensive than those of most other kinds of conveyors. When the
distance to be traversed by the material is short, the worm
conveyor has this advantage, that it is cheaper than other kinds
of conveyors. If it be
desired not only to convey
but also to mix two
or more materials, such
as cement and sand in a
dry state, or poultry
food, this appliance is
thoroughly well adapted
for the work. On the
other hand, there is a
grinding action exercised
on any material
conveyed, and when
hard or cutting substances
are handled the
wear and tear on the
conveyor blades, trough
and bearings is very
great, and the power absorbed by a worm conveyor is a
sensible item.</p>

<p><i>Band Conveyors.</i>&mdash;The inventor of band conveyors for the
handling of grain and minerals was G. F. Lyster, who, as already
mentioned, in 1868 carried out exhaustive experiments at the
Liverpool docks, where he established the band conveyor as a
grain-handler. For granaries the band conveyor is an ideal
appliance. Its capacity is great, and it can be run at relatively
high speeds with a moderate expenditure of power. The band
conveyor of to-day is an endless belt of canvas or more often
india-rubber with insertion, and when fitted with the usual
receiving and delivery appliances can be used to handle grain
from or into granaries and also to feed bins or sections of a warehouse.
The endless bands run over terminal pulleys, and are
also supported on their way by a series of guide rollers, which
are in greater number on the loaded than on the empty strand.
The band is usually run quite flat, except that at the point or
points where the grain is fed on it is slightly hollowed for a few
feet, by means of two curving rolls which are set obliquely so as
to make it trough-shaped. The supporting or guide rollers are
4 in. to 6 in. in diameter, and are sometimes made of wood, but
more often consist of steel tubes to which spindles with conical
end gudgeons are secured. The gudgeons generally run in
suitable bush-bearings, which should be well lubricated. Band
conveyors should be driven on the delivery and not the receiving
terminal, as the tight side of the band is the flattest. The guide
rollers, for ordinary grain conveyors, are fitted to the upper or
working side of the band at intervals of about 6 ft., and at
distances of 12 ft. on the lower or return strand. In cases where
both strands of the band are used for carrying grain, the lower
strand must be supported by as many rollers as the upper.
Under such conditions, terminal pulleys must be of larger
diameter than usual, the object being to throw the two strands
farther apart, so as to give sufficient space between the two
strands to spout the feed in and out again at the other end.
The two strands can be run any distance apart by the use of
two additional pulleys for the terminals. This arrangement
would be in place where it was desired, as it might be, to run
one strand of the band along the top floor of the granary to
distribute, while the other strand travelled along the ground-floor
or basement to withdraw, the grain.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Throw-off Carriage for Band Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Band conveyors are kept tight, when the band is not very long,
by a tightening gear, similar to that used on elevators, and consisting
of two screws which push or better pull the two pedestals of one
terminal pulley farther away from the other terminal. If the band
is of such length that an adjustment of 4 to 5 ft. on the tightening
gear is not sufficient, it is advisable to use in place of screws a tightening
pulley, over which the belt passes, but which is itself held in
tension by weights. The choice of the exact tightening gear will
depend on various considerations, the length of the belt, the type
of throw-off carriage used, and the quality of the belt all being
factors to be considered. The throw-off carriage (fig. 6), which
serves to withdraw material from the band at any desired point,
is a simple but ingenious appliance consisting essentially of guide
pulleys which by raising one part of the band and lowering the other
have the effect of causing the grain to quit the surface of the band
at the point where it is deflected upwards. The grain is thus cast
clear of the band, and into the air, being caught as it falls in a hopper
and spouted in any desired direction. Throw-off carriages differ in
certain details, but the principle is the same. For feeding a band
conveyor it is important to give the material a horizontal velocity,
approaching that of the band. The grain should therefore be fed
through a spout rather less in breadth than half of the width of the
band, and set at an incline of 42½° to the horizontal. Band conveyors
run at a speed of 400 to 600 ft. per minute, according to the
nature of the material; oats, for instance, would be liable to be
blown off the band at a speed in excess of 500, which would be
suitable for wheat. Nuts, maize and the heavier seeds could be
carried at 600. The power consumption by a grain-laden band
compares favourably with any other form of conveyor. An 18-in.
band 100 ft. in length running 500 ft. per minute would carry 50 tons
per hour at an expenditure of only 4.5 H.P.</p>

<p>While the band conveyor is an ideal conveyor in warehouses
and mills, it is also capable of rendering good service in handling
such heavy materials as coal and minerals. Of course for such
purposes the band and its fittings must be of much more substantial
construction. The central portions of the band carrying
the load, being subjected to great wear and tear, are often made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
of solid india-rubber extending to nearly half the thickness of
the band in the middle, and tapering off towards the edges, while
the surface facing the guide rollers is of insertion coated with
india-rubber. Bands properly prepared and stretched will bear
a strain of 3 tons to the square inch. Balata bands may be
used in place of india-rubber, but though less expensive are not
so lasting. Bands that have to carry coal or minerals are usually
curved along the entire
length of the upper or
loaded strand into a trough
shape by guide rollers (fig.
7). Bands of woven wire
are sometimes used with
coal-washing plants, but
have the disadvantage of
lack of durability. They
are more liable to stretch
and are high in price. They
may be run as high as about 600 ft. per minute, but to ensure
proper grip-driving terminals must either be faced with leather
or made of wood.</p>

<p>The speed of band conveyors loaded with coal or minerals
greatly depends on the size of the fragments; the proper speed
for large pieces would be 150-200 ft. per minute, while smaller
material could be carried at a maximum velocity of 700-750 ft.
Band conveyors will carry in an upward direction, up to 24
degrees, without any loss of capacity. They can be used not
only to carry light and heavy bodies, such as grain and coal,
in a continuous stream, but also to convey relatively large
bodies such as sacks of flour, or cement, &amp;c., intermittently.
Thus a band 26 in. wide and 350 ft. long is used at a flour-mill
in York to load sacks of flour into railway trucks; by this
means 12 wagons can be loaded by two men in 1 hour. Band
conveyors are not necessarily fixed in one place. A portable
model has rendered good service in tunnel-cutting, mining and
quarrying. This band is mounted in a light steel frame, itself
fitted with small wheels, so as to be readily put in any required
position, and is entirely self-contained, being provided with
tightening gear, a small motor, &amp;c. If required, several lengths
can be joined together, or one band can deliver upon another
at a lower level. The same advantages that attend the use of
the band-conveyor for handling grain may be claimed for this
appliance when carrying coal and heavy bodies, namely the
demand for relatively small power, smooth and noiseless work,
and gentle handling of material. On the other hand the feed
cannot be withdrawn at intermediate points except by means
of a throw-off carriage. The numerous bearings of the guide
rollers require careful lubrication, and the rubber bands should
be protected as much as possible from changes of temperature.</p>

<p>The <i>metal band</i> or belt conveyor, a modification of the rubber
or canvas band conveyors, is an endless belt composed of iron
plates connected to endless chains, usually of malleable cast iron,
running under the plates. Such appliances, being obviously
more cumbrous than band conveyors, are only used in handling
material of a hard and cutting nature. They usually deliver only
at the end, but if intermediate delivery be desired a scraper may
be so fixed across the band at a given point, at an angle of 45°, as
to scrape the whole or part of the feed into a shoot, or a scraper
may be mounted obliquely on a suitable carriage which can be
moved to any points at which delivery may be required. In
some bands of this type supporting rollers are attached to the
links and travel with them, or are fixed to the framing so that
the band runs over them, an arrangement which has the advantage
of economizing driving power and of promoting smooth
running. Metal band conveyors are tightened in the same way
as textile or rubber bands, and may run at a speed of 60 to 120
ft. per minute. The driving gear must always be placed at the
delivery terminal, so that the loaded strand is in tension. Such
appliances are often used as sorting tables or picking bands, for
instance, for coal, cement, minerals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In another modification of the metal band conveyor, the
<i>travelling trough</i> conveyor, the sides of each plate are turned up
so as to form the conveying surface of the band into a continuous
trough. With this arrangement intermediate delivery is impossible,
as the sides of the trough will not allow the use of a
scraper. As compared with push-plate conveyors (which consist
of scrapers mounted on endless travelling chains that run usually
in troughs), travelling trough conveyors are gentle handlers of
material.</p>

<p>A conveyor which is capable of dealing with many different
kinds of material is known as the <i>vibrating trough</i> conveyor.
It is so far like the band and travelling trough conveyor that
the material it conveys from one point to another is conveyed
without the use of any stirring or pushing agent, such as belong
to worm, push-plate and cable trough conveyors. For materials
requiring gentle treatment, this type of conveyor is eminently
suitable. There are different kinds of vibrating trough conveyors.
In one type the trough is caused to make a reciprocating motion
by means of a crank and connecting rod, the trough itself being
supported on rollers. In another type the trough is actuated
by a cam, or by cranks with some kind of quick return motion.
In the appliance known as the Zimmer or swinging conveyor
the trough is supported in its reciprocating motion by means
of laminated spring legs set obliquely to the trough. These
legs are securely bolted at one end to the floor or any other
solid support, and at the other end to the trough itself; hence
no lubrication is required, as would be the case with supporting
rollers. Moreover the combined action of the reciprocating
motion of the crank and the rocking of the spring legs has the
effect of causing the material to travel faster in the trough with
a given stroke of the crank than would be the case with any
other support. The material to be conveyed is not carried
along with its support as in the case of a band or travelling
trough conveyor, but is caused to move in a series of hops, to
use popular language.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Swinging or Zimmer Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The action will be sufficiently explained by the appended diagram
(fig. 8), which, however, is exaggerated to give a clearer idea of the
actual movements, which are on quite a small scale. The line AB
represents the bottom of the trough, while CC are two of the spring
legs; the full lines indicate the spring legs at the extreme backward
position of the crank, while the dotted lines show the spring legs
and bottom of the trough at the extreme forward position of the
crank D. The material to be conveyed, represented by E, is thrown
forward by the forward movement of the crank, and describes a short
parabolic curve; it is thrown at about a right angle to the inclined
legs CC, but before it has time to complete its parabolic course, the
trough has been moved by the crank into its original position. As
soon as the material has dropped down, the trough makes another
forward movement, whereupon the material is thrown forward
another stage, and this process, which is continually repeated, as
indicated by the letters E<span class="su">1</span>, E<span class="su">2</span>, E<span class="su">3</span>, has the effect of carrying or
conveying the material in the direction desired. It is important to
note that the actual movement both of trough and material is within
narrow bounds; the horizontal movement of the trough is only
about 1 in., while the vertical or upward movement is about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in.
The material is conveyed by this vibrating trough with a minimum
of friction, as it is evident that the material is carried forward without
any contact with the trough, while the very nature of the motion
precludes injurious friction between the particles themselves. When
the trough is full the material will move as it were in a solid mass.</p>

<p>An important improvement in this type of vibrating trough
conveyor is the balanced conveyor, in which the trough is made
in two sections, one being placed at a slightly lower level than the
other, so that one-half may deliver into the other half. The two
sections are driven by triple or quadruple cranks set at an angle
of about 180° to one another. In this case one-half of the conveyor
will move forward while the other moves backward, thus balancing
each other (fig. 9). At the same time the material keeps moving
in the same direction because all the spring legs are of the same
inclination. It is usual to drive balanced conveyors at or near the
centre of their length, but they may also be driven from one end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
in which case the balancing of the conveyor would be effected by
a powerful volute spring which is compressed and released by a crank
and connecting rod, in place of being connected to one-half of the
conveyor. Two sections of a Zimmer conveyor can be made to run
in opposite directions by merely reversing the inclination of the
spring legs; in such a case the sections of a trough would be connected
by a flexible coupling. Conveyors of this type have been
used in lengths up to 500 ft., and in widths of over 6 ft. The feed
can be received or discharged at any desired point in the length;
for drawing off material at intermediate points it is only necessary
to open a slide in the bottom of the trough. If a great increase be
desired in the capacity of this conveyor the connecting rod may be
attached, not to the trough at all, but to the spring legs at a point
of about a third or half-way from the base, so that the free ends of
the legs can swing the trough backward and forward; by this means
the stroke is amplified and consequently the capacity is increased,
while the driving power required is practically the same.</p>

<p>The power absorbed by the Zimmer conveyor is comparatively
small; a length of 100 ft. conveying a load of 50 tons per hour takes
8.75 h.p. With a speed of 300-370 revolutions per minute of the
conveyor, the material will traverse 40-70 ft. per minute. The gentle
action of this appliance has caused it to be largely used in dealing
with friable materials, such as coal. The simplicity of the mechanism
leaves little to get out of order, and the entire absence of travelling
gear, such as supporting rollers, is a valuable feature. The
capacity of the conveyor may be sensibly increased by running it on
a downward gradient, while the capacity will be correspondingly
diminished by working in an upward direction. Among many
purposes for which this type of conveyor has been found suitable
is that of a drainer in connexion with coal-washing plants. A perforated
plate at the head will allow the water to escape, while the
coal is carried to the other end. A slight upward slant permits the
water left with the coal to run back and escape. In colliery work
this conveyor makes a suitable picking table. The motion of the
trough, while not so fast as to baffle the pickers, has the advantage
of uniformly spreading the lumps of coal. This apparatus also lends
itself to the grading of coal. All that is necessary is to fit the trough
with a sieve which divides it into an upper and lower deck. The
coarser material passes along the top of the sieve, while the finer
coal, sifted out by the perforations, travels along the bottom of the
trough till discharged. In spite of the gentle propelling action of
this conveyor, it has a thorough sifting action; a perforated plate
from 10 to 12 ft. long is usually sufficient to separate any desired
grade, and at a certain Belgian colliery a conveyor of this type fitted
with grading sieves feeds seven trucks standing in a row, but each
on a different siding, and each taking coal of a different size. This
conveyor has been found useful both as a drying and cooling appliance.
Several substances of a sticky nature, such as moist sugar,
which are difficult to deal with mechanically, can be efficiently
handled by the swinging conveyor.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>gravity</i> or <i>tilting bucket</i> conveyor can be used as a combined
elevator and conveyor. It consists essentially of two endless
chains or ropes held at fixed distances apart by suitable bars
which are fitted with small rollers at each end. Every link, or
second link, carries a bucket, and the whole forms an endless
chain of buckets. But these buckets, unlike elevator buckets,
which are bolted on to a band or chain, are free to move on the
axis on which they are suspended above their centre of gravity.
When the conveyor is at work the buckets will always be in an
upright position, whether the motion be vertical or horizontal.
Each bucket carries its load to the point at which delivery is
required, where an adjustable tippling device is ready to catch
and tilt the bucket, thus emptying it. This type of conveyor is
chiefly used in connexion with coal stores and boiler houses,
where it has undeniable advantages. For instance, in feeding
overhead bunkers a well-designed gravity bucket conveyor may
do the work of (1) a horizontal conveyor in bringing coal from the
railway siding, (2) a vertical elevator in raising it to the bunkers,
and (3) a horizontal conveyor in distributing it to the respective
bunkers. In some cases the returning empty strand of buckets is
used to clear the ashes from under the boilers.</p>

<p>Conveyors of this type run at a mean rate of 40 ft. per minute,
and if it be desired to attain a given capacity the size of the
buckets must be adapted to the increased load as an increase of
speed for a higher capacity is impracticable. The power absorbed
is not great, the heaviest demand on the motive force being
made by the elevating operation. Such conveyors have the merit
of handling the material gently, while feeding and discharging can
take place at any point. There are many journals to be looked
after, but in the most approved systems their lubrication is
effected automatically. Whilst such a plant has the advantage
of requiring only one driving gear, a breakdown at one point of
the installation means the stoppage of the whole.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among typical conveyors on this system is the Hunt conveyor
(fig. 10), which consists of a double link carrying a series of pivoted
buckets which are free to revolve on their axes at all points, except
at that point at which they discharge. This operation is effected
by a cam action, the buckets on their release righting themselves
and becoming ready for refilling. The driving gear propels the
chain by means of pawls which engage with the cross studs of the
chain and have a central thrusting action. Another well-known
appliance of this type is the pan bucket conveyor. This consists
of a continuous trough built in sections and supported on axles and
guide wheels running on suitable rails. There is one axle to each
section, and in each section of the trough a bucket is pivoted to the
sides. There are several other conveyors of this type, amongst
which the &ldquo;Tipit&rdquo; should be mentioned. For the Bousse gravity
conveyor it is claimed that it will go round any curve backwards or
forwards in both planes, and is therefore adaptable for installations
when the typical gravity bucket would be useless. The buckets of
this conveyor are coupled together by a link in the middle, which
obviously allows more latitude in negotiating curves than the double
chain of most of the other types.</p>

<p><i>Pneumatic Grain Elevators</i> have been employed with good
effect in loading and unloading grain from ships. This method of
conveying grain falls under three systems: (1) the blast system;
(2) the suction system; and (3) the combined blast and suction
system.</p>

<p>In the first system a barge, known as a machinery barge, is
fitted with a steam boiler, a set of air compressing engines, and a
length of flexible piping long enough to reach from any part of
the barge to the farthest corner of the ship to be loaded. A
small pipe, known as the nozzle, is inserted at the inlet end of the
piping, where the grain is taken in, and communicates with the
air compressor at the other end. Compressed air can be admitted
to the nozzle or shut off by a valve. The inlet end of the
flexible pipe is pushed into the grain in the barge, while the other
end is led over the hatches of the vessel to be loaded. As the
compressor is set to work and the valve of the compressed air
supply pipe opened, the air naturally rushes up the pipe and
escapes at the other end which is lying over the ship&rsquo;s hatchway.
If the inlet nozzle be immersed in the grain to the depth of 12 to
18 in. the induced atmospheric air will follow the lead of the
compressed air, and drawing the grain around into the inlet
nozzle will carry it up the pipe and deliver it into the hold of the
vessel loading.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Travelling Bucket Elevator.</td></tr></table>

<p>In the suction system, which is identified with the name of
F. E. Duckham, the process is somewhat different. An air-tight
tank or receiver, 8 to 10 ft. in diameter and 10 to 20 ft. high, is
fitted with a hopper bottom, and is erected, if floating, on a barge,
at a sufficient height to allow grain falling from the hopper
bottom, and passing through an air lock, to be delivered by
gravity through a shoot into the vessel being loaded. A pipe
connects the vacuum tank with the exhaust pumps. Several
flexible pipes of sufficient length to reach any corner of the ship to
be unloaded, may be connected with the vacuum tank. As the
air pumps are set working a partial vacuum is formed within the
tank, and as the nozzle end of the pipe is immersed into the grain
to the depth of a few inches, the air and grain are drawn in at the
mouth of the nozzle and carried along the pipe to the vacuum
tank. The natural expansion of the air then lets the grain drop to
the hopper bottom, whence it issues from an air-lock valve,
while the air is drawn away by a pipe communicating with the
pumps and is thence discharged into the open.</p>

<p>In the third system, or blast and suction combined, the grain
is sucked into a vacuum tank, as just described, and drops from
this through valves into a second receptacle, whence it is conveyed
to any desired point by flexible pipes. This second tank
is divided into two sections and provided with valves so that the
two sections will alternately be under the influence of blast or
suction. Alternatively the grain is discharged by an automatic
valve from the vacuum tank into the second air-tight chamber
which communicates with the compressed air chamber. From
this section the grain is discharged by an outlet pipe by the
agency of compressed air. A similar system was introduced by
Messrs Haviland &amp; Farmer, who have, however, since abandoned
it on account of difficulties connected with the application of the
blast, which was found to abrade the grain rather severely,
especially at the bends in the pipes. An even greater objection
was the delivery of dust with the grain, which made it impossible
for trimmers to remain in the hold while the elevator was at
work. Messrs Haviland and Farmer now work on the suction
system, in which they claim to have introduced several improvements,
notably in regard to the purification of the air between the
vacuum chamber and the exhaustors, and in devising a new
automatic air trap.</p>

<p>The first pneumatic suction elevator in Great Britain was
erected at the Millwall docks (London) under the Duckham
patents. At Sulina, on the Lower Danube, a pneumatic elevator
erected on the Haviland-Farmer system, which has undergone
one or two reconstructions, has been proved capable of elevating
160 tons of grain per hour with 375 i.h.p.</p>

<p>The only objection to pneumatic elevators appears to be that of
expense. The cost of installation is relatively heavy, and the
power required for working is large. But in dealing with vessels
carrying heavy cargoes of grain the saving of labour and demurrage
is sufficient to justify the large outlay of capital required in
ports where there is sufficient grain traffic.</p>

<p><i>Hot Coke Conveyors.</i>&mdash;Hot coke is admittedly one of the most
difficult materials to handle by mechanical means, and though it
might be too much to say that all difficulties have been surmounted
by the engineer, it has, since the end of the 19th century,
been more or less satisfactorily handled by machinery. Even in a
dry state coke is a troublesome material to handle by machinery.
It is of a gritty and rasping nature, and is at the same time very
friable. Unless it is gently handled, breakage is bound to occur
and to result in the making of a certain proportion of fine dust
known as &ldquo;breeze.&rdquo; Apart from the depreciation in the value of
the coke, this breeze is a sharp, cutting material, calculated to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
considerable injury to the working parts of the conveyor, such as
chains, and to the bearings, if it can get inside. Of course the
conveying of the coke in an incandescent condition is another
serious difficulty, as this glowing material must be quenched by
water, a sufficiently delicate operation in itself. The chief use for
hot coke conveyors has been found in connexion with gas works,
but attempts have also been made to provide efficient machinery
for the service of coke ovens of great capacity.</p>

<p>The justification of any kind of machinery must rest on its
relative efficiency and economy. As compared with some other
materials the mechanical handling of hot coke does not realize
such a striking economy; a hot coke conveyor is expensive to
build&mdash;on account of the great wear and tear it must be very
solidly constructed&mdash;and it is costly in upkeep. Still in large gas
works the use of machinery for treating glowing coke is economically
advisable. Exact calculations are not very easy to make,
because while the cost of hand labour in this department of a gas
works is accurately known, the efficiency of different hot coke
conveyors varies. G. E. Stephenson, of the Gathorn gas works,
estimated that a saving of 4¾d. per ton had been realized on each
ton of coke conveyed to the yard from the retort house, as
against the same material wheeled in barrows. This saving
represented the difference between the cost of twelve men, who
formerly handled the hot coke with shovels and barrows, and the
cost of one conveyor with the wages of one man to look after it.
In an ordinary way one man would rake out the coke from the
retort mouthpiece into a barrow placed underneath, while a
second man quenched the glowing coke with buckets of water, or
better still with a hose. Then the barrow would be wheeled out
into the yard. Obviously this is a slow and relatively expensive
method, apart from the deleterious fumes arising from the
quenching of the coke. Some improvement was effected by the
substitution for the old hand-barrows of cage-like tipping trucks;
these are run on narrow gauge rails out of the retort house and
the red-hot coke they contain is quenched by a copious spray,
the truck being placed the while over a grating through which the
surplus water is drained away, under an inverted funnel with an
uptake to carry away the fumes and vapours. These trucks
have been hauled, in lieu of human arms, by endless ropes or even
small locomotives.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The earlier hot coke conveyors were of the <i>pushplate</i> type. The
trough, some 27 in. wide, consisted of cast iron sections, while the
pushplates, formed of malleable castings, were attached at a pitch
of 24 in. to a central chain and were pulled along on a wrought iron
bar, which could be renewed when necessary. These conveyors with
a speed of 48 ft. per minute, had a capacity of some 20 tons per hour.
A conveyor constructed on these lines was installed at the Gathorn
works in 1903. The wear and tear was very great; moreover the
chain, being central, suffered severely from the hot coke, to the
action of which it was directly exposed.</p>

<p>The New Conveyor Company&rsquo;s conveyor consists of a water-tight
trough through which pass closely-fitting tray plates, attached to a
single chain. These plates are joggled down at one end to receive
the flat front part of the succeeding plate, with the aim of excluding
the breeze from the under part of the carrying plate. The chain is
made entirely of steel with side rollers attached to every third plate,
the plates, ¼ in. thick, are dished in the shape of a tray, which is less
liable to distortion (from heat) than a flat plate. The speed of travel
is about 45 ft. per minute, while the capacity when handling coke
from 20 ft. retorts is some 30 tons per hour.</p>

<p>A conveyor made by Messrs Graham, Morton &amp; Co., consists of
a travelling tray, the sections of which are joined together by steel
spindles provided with a roller at each end, the latter running on
suitable rails. These sections consist of steel castings with a number
of lateral slots; thus the tray has the appearance of a travelling
grating. To receive the quenching water that escapes through the
grating a trough is placed beneath, and a scraper is used to free the
trough of the dust escaping through the grating.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Bronder Hot Coke Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<p>An interesting conveyor is that of G. A. Bronder, of New York
(fig. 11), which has some affinity with the gravity bucket conveyor.
It runs in a water-tight trough which is filled up to a certain height,
the water being slowly circulated by mechanism which resembles
a water wheel. The chain of buckets runs in the trough, the sides
forming the rails for the supporting rollers. The conveyor is covered
in along its whole length, and forms a sort of flue which is connected
at each bench with a number of shoots through which the coke
drops into the conveyor buckets. A pipe of large diameter is connected
with an exhaust fan, which draws away the fumes created
by the quenching process, and sends them into a chimney discharging
into the open. The chain and buckets, being carried on rollers
which run on the outer edge of the trough, cannot come in contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
either with the hot coke or with gritty particles. The chain of
buckets is connected by horseshoe-shaped brackets extending
upwards beyond the sides of the buckets and connected with the
links of the driving chains. When the conveyor is at work the covers
of the mouth-pieces are opened and the coke is fed into the buckets;
simultaneously the water valves are opened and the glowing coke is
quenched. Any breeze which may have fallen between the buckets
is collected by a scraper and delivered into a tank at one end, while
the propeller wheel draws the water from this tank and drives it
back to the other end of the trough. The top strand is the working
strand and delivers its load at the terminal. One important difference
between an ordinary gravity bucket conveyor and this apparatus
is that the buckets are here rigidly connected to the supporting
wheels.</p>

<p>The West hot coke conveyor consists of a strongly-built trough
in which a single wide chain partly carries and partly drags the coke.
In the trough is a false bottom, the plates of which are loosely fixed
and kept in position by angle irons on which the chain drags. By
two arm-like extensions the links of the chain are widened right
across the trough. The pitch of the chain is 12 in., so that all the
large pieces of coke are more carried than dragged. The speed of
travel is about 40 ft. per minute.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Wild Coke Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<p>The Wild conveyor (fig. 12) consists of a cast iron or steel trough
24 to 30 in. wide by 9 in. deep, supported by cast iron brackets to
which the rails that support the strands of the chain are secured.
Both chains run outside the trough, and are secured on either side
to the pushplates, so that only the scraper comes in contact with
the hot coke. Every second link of the 12 in. pitch chain carries
a push or scraper-plate, as shown in illustration.</p>

<p>The De Brouwer hot coke conveyor, which is much used in gas
works both in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe, was
invented by a Belgian engineer. Its construction has undergone
many modifications which experience has shown to be desirable.
It consists of a trough of cast or wrought iron, or mild steel, 20 to
36 in. wide and 3 to 6 in. deep. Double endless chains run in the
corners of the trough, the two chains being connected together by
round cross bars set 30 in. apart, so as to form a sort of ladder. The
hot coke is carried or dragged along by these bars. One end of
the trough is closed and the other is bent upwards with a view to
retaining the quenching water. As the hot coke is dragged along
it is subjected to the action of jets of water. The conveyor bars,
which act as scrapers, sweep the water and the coke along the
trough till the point is reached where the latter curves upwards.
Then the water flows back like a small cascade on the half-quenched
coke, which is thus thoroughly extinguished. Considerable inclines
can be negotiated with this conveyor; in some installations on the
continent of Europe angles of 30° to the horizontal have been
surmounted. In a modification of the De Brouwer conveyor, installed
at the Cassel gas works, the bars which form the rungs of
the conveyor were replaced by cast iron rakes. In another modified
form, the work of F. A. Marshall, to be found in the Copenhagen
gas works, sluices are provided for withdrawing an excess of water
at any point in the trough.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Sempster Coke Conveyor.</td></tr></table>

<p>In Great Britain a hot coke conveyor has been designed on
similar lines by Messrs R. Dempster &amp; Sons, Ltd. (fig. 13). The
chains are parallel from end to end, and are composed of identical
and interchangeable malleable cast links. Instead of the chains
carrying the rollers, as is often the case, the chains are themselves
carried and guided by flanged rollers supported from the framework.
This arrangement has the advantage of decreasing the weight of the
chain, as neither the rollers nor the lubricators have to be conveyed,
being stationary. The scrapers are of cast steel and have a rake-like
shape with a view to minimize the breakage of coke.</p>
</div>

<p>The essential features in a hot coke conveyor are strength and
simplicity, a minimum of wearing parts, interchangeability of
wearing surfaces and of worn and broken parts, protection of
wearing and working parts from contact with the hot coke, and
facilities for keeping the temperature of the conveyor as even
as possible, so as to avoid distortion of parts through sudden
changes. To attain these latter conditions, it appears essential
to construct conveyors of the pushplate type. In these the hot
coke is kept continually moving, and thus the good effect is
secured of heating the conveyor from end to end uniformly and
gradually. This applies particularly to gas works conveyors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
For the service of coke ovens the plate or tray conveyor might
be suitable because more gentle. It must be remembered that
coke oven conveyors must be of large capacity, and moreover
in this case there is more scope for cooling the coke in front of
the oven before it is removed to the conveyor, the work being
all effected in the open.</p>

<p><i>Elevators.</i>&mdash;This term is here confined to its proper meaning
(in English engineering treatises) of a device for raising material
in a vertical or slanting direction by means of buckets attached
to endless belts or chains. Lifts for passengers are also sometimes
termed elevators (<i>q.v.</i>), and in America the term is
also currently applied to the granary or warehouse in which
grain is stored (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Granaries</a></span>).</p>

<p>In the bucket elevator, an endless belt or chain runs
over terminal pulleys which are fixed at different levels, the
distance from centre to centre of these pulleys beings known
as the length of the elevator. The design and construction
of the elevator will be varied to suit its purpose. Grain
elevators are invariably cased in wooden or iron trunks, and
the head and foot are also of wood or iron, iron trunks
being particularly used in so-called fire-proof buildings.
The trunk of the grain elevator (fig. 14) is almost always
vertical whilst the band to which the buckets are attached
may consist of leather, cotton, hemp, webbing or other suitable
substances. When an elevator is intended for lifting
heavy materials, such as coal, coke or cement, it is usually
set at a slant (figs. 15 and 16), and the endless belt is
replaced by one or two strands of endless chain which
support the buckets and run over the terminal sprocket
wheels. The buckets are attached to the links of the
chains, and to prevent these heavy buckets and chains
from sagging in their inclined position, rollers or more
often short skidder bars are fixed to each bucket, sliding
on well-oiled angle bars on each side of the elevator frame.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Grain Elevator.</td></tr></table>

<p>Both grain and mineral elevators are usually fitted with
tightening gears to keep the belt or chain taut; these are
generally placed at the lower or well end so as not to
interfere with the position of the upper terminal, which is
almost invariably the driven one. The tightening of the
band at the bottom terminal in the elevator well necessarily
alters the space between the terminal pulley and the bottom
of the well. This is of little consequence in grain elevators,
but for elevators intended to handle coal or any material
of varying size the ordinary tightening gear is unsuitable. In
such a case the best plan is to attach the elevator-well to
the terminal in such a way as to go up or down with the
sprocket wheel when the chain is loosened or tightened,
while the foot bracket which supports the well and terminal
spindle remains a fixture. In order to tighten elevator
chains without interfering with either of the terminals,
adjustable jockey pulleys at some suitable point may be
used, and the desired effect can thus be attained by pressing
against the chains and thereby taking up the slack without
any interference with either the feed or delivery end.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Elevator buckets must be proportioned to the size and nature of
the material they are intended to carry, and care must be taken to
maintain a uniform feed. This may readily be effected by adjustable
outlets and spouts for grain and the like, and by certain feeding
devices for handling minerals of uneven size. For instance, an oscillating
feed shoot making from 30 to 60 oscillations per minute can be
installed in such a case, and adjusted to deposit at each backward
and forward stroke the exact amount of material adapted to the
capacity of the elevator. The speed of the shoot will naturally vary
with the size of material to be fed. For small coal 60 oscillations
would be about the correct speed; for large coal the speed might
be reduced to 30 or less. Speaking generally, care should always be
taken to prevent an undue rush of feed, that is, more than the
elevator can take up, and if tenacious materials are handled, feeding
devices should be employed provided with stirrers or agitators that
will effectually keep the material moving and prevent any larger
lumps from arching over the feed spout, and thus producing chokes.
Elevators should always be fed from that side on which the buckets
ascend, that the stream of material may meet the elevator buckets
on their upward journey. This will prevent the material from
filling up the elevator well and spare the buckets from dredging
through an accumulation of feed. Elevators erected at an incline
are best fed at a point several feet above the well into the chain of
ascending buckets, as under such conditions little will miss the
buckets and drop into the well.</p>

<p>The reason why grain elevators are set vertically, whereas elevators
intended to carry heavy bodies such as coal and ore are
generally inclined at an angle, is that the former can be run at a
much greater velocity than the latter. Grain, for instance, would be
uninjured by a velocity at the delivery end which would fracture
coal and seriously reduce its value, to say nothing of the dust production
and the damage which would be done to the receiving
spouts and shoots. Elevators carrying a light material can be run
at a circumferential velocity of 250 to 350 ft. per minute, and if
vertically set, will throw the grain, &amp;c., clear of the elevator into
the shoot for its reception. On the other hand, elevators handling
heavy material must be set at an angle in order to give a clear delivery
at a much lower speed of 50 to 60 ft. per minute; in other
words, the elevator is so inclined that the shoot for the reception
of the material can be put underneath the delivering buckets which
slowly disgorge their load. To obtain good results, without taking
up too much space, an elevator carrying heavy material should be
set at 40° to 60° to the horizontal. The same results can be obtained
if the main portion of the elevator is vertical and only the upper
portion inclined, or so curved as to bring the delivery over the shoot.
The speed at which vertical elevators should be run will depend
on the diameter of the terminal pulley, that is, the pulley over which
the buckets and bands pass. The centrifugal force of pulleys revolving
at the same speed is in direct proportion to their diameters, and
this is twice as much in a 2 ft. as in a 1 ft. pulley. It may be taken
that the centrifugal force of a pulley will increase in proportion to
the square of its velocity; hence the centrifugal force of a pulley
2 ft. in diameter running at 50 revolutions per minute will be four
times the centrifugal force of a pulley of the same diameter making
only 25 revolutions per minute. It must not be forgotten that to
effect a clean discharge of the buckets of a vertical elevator, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
centrifugal force must be sufficient to overcome the gravity of the
material, because the material thrown off the delivery pulley in a
horizontal direction will be more rapidly deflected into a parabolic
curve the higher its specific gravity. It follows that for a specifically
heavy material a greater centrifugal force will be required; that
is to say, the elevator will
have to be higher speeded
than in dealing with a lighter
material.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Mineral Elevator, upper terminal.</td></tr></table>

<p>Elevator buckets must be
varied according to the nature
of the material; for instance,
shallow buckets will be found
best for a soft and clinging
material such as flour, moist
sugar, sand, small coal, &amp;c.,
while for a hard or semi-hard
body such as wheat, coal,
&amp;c., deeper buckets are preferable.
On account of their lower
speed, elevators for specifically
heavy material require much
larger buckets and chains than
grain elevators of the same bulk
capacity. The most economical
form of elevator is fitted with a
continuous chain of buckets.
Such elevators may be constructed
to carry either grain or
minerals. The advantages are
greater capacity than an ordinary
elevator of the same dimensions
and a more uniform delivery;
moreover, smoother running is
secured, since the buckets being
close together need not plunge
intermittently through the contents
of the elevator-well.</p>

<p><i>Intermittent Conveyors.</i>&mdash;The
elevators we have been considering, whether used for carrying
and distributing coal or grain, have this in common, that
they raise material from a lower to a higher level, so to speak,
in a continuous stream, the continuity being broken only
by the short spaces between the buckets. In the continuous
bucket type indeed the stream of material is practically, if
not absolutely, continuous. In all these cases the elevator
is fed with the material in a continuous stream, and by
some mechanical means; whether by band, worm or shoot,
is immaterial. Elevators of a somewhat different and more
substantial construction may be and are often used for handling
filled sacks, barrels, carcases of animals and other bulky objects,
which cannot be delivered in a uniform stream, but may have
to be conveyed by the elevator intermittently. The ordinary
buckets used for grain or coal are replaced by other appliances
for gripping and holding the object to be raised from a lower to
a higher level, but in principle these appliances are essentially
elevators.</p>

<p>Another kind of elevator, known as a <i>lift</i> or <i>hoist</i>, is used in
mines and quarries and in serving blast furnaces. This is an
elevator with one or two buckets. Essentially a heavy load
lifter, it is intended for material of too large a bulk to be handled
economically by ordinary elevators, and is employed for lifting
in either a vertical or, more often, an inclined direction.</p>

<p>For elevating materials, such as large coal, iron ore, limestone,
&amp;c., which are too large to be fed into ordinary elevators, and
must therefore be handled intermittently, the single bucket
elevator or hoist may be used with advantage. But as the
essential use of mechanical appliances for handling material is
to save human labour as far as possible, that hoist will prove
the most economical the operation of which is as automatic as
possible. The Americans seem to have been pioneers in the
construction of <i>furnace hoists</i>, which form the principal elevators
of this class, but some excellent examples of the modern furnace
hoist are now to be found in Great Britain and elsewhere in
Europe. Generally speaking, a furnace hoist consists of an
inclined iron bridge girder set at an angle to the upright shaft
of the furnace. On this incline are laid rails for the ascent and
descent of the bucket, which in this case is known as a skip and
is provided with suitable wheels, while the hoisting gear manipulating
the skips by a steel rope is erected on or near the ground
level. The rails when they approach the upper terminus are
usually bent in a more or less horizontal position so as automatically
to tilt and thereby unload the skip. To attain the
same end, the rails supporting the back wheels of the skips may
be bent at the terminus, or the back wheels may have additional
wheels of a larger diameter on the other side of their flanges, so
that during the ascent and descent the skip runs on its four
normal wheels, while at the upper terminus the outer and larger
back wheels engage with short lengths of extra rails and thus
tilt and effect the automatic clearance of the skip. The dead
weight of the skip may be balanced by a counter weight, or
double tracks may be laid, so that the empty skip descends on
one track whilst the loaded skip is being raised on the other.
In this case the distributing hopper at the top of the furnace has
an elongated shape so as to take the charges
alternately from buckets on either track.
Again, the two tracks may be laid one above
the other, so that one skip runs on the upper
rails and the other on
the lower. The two
buckets will pass each
other at about the
centre of the framing,
where there will be
plenty of room for
clearance.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:516px; height:698px" src="images/img61b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Mineral Elevator, lower terminal.</td></tr></table>

<p>The capacity of the
skip will of course depend
to some extent on the capacity of the furnace, but an
average charge may be put down at 2 tons of ore and lime, or
1 ton of coke. To raise such a charge to a furnace 80 ft. high
would require, assuming no counter weight were used, a motor
of about 100 h.p. On account of the great speed at which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
the hoist works, the time taken in raising the charged skip,
discharging it, and returning it empty would be only 30 to
40 seconds. The hoist cable runs over guide pulleys placed
at the top of the furnace, and the cable is often manipulated
by an electrically driven winch in a cabin below. The
descent of the empty skip in more modern installations
is utilized to effect an even distribution of the feed from
the hopper to the furnace by causing the hopper to revolve.
To this end the latter is provided with an ingenious mechanism
which only comes into operation as the car descends. After
every charge shot into the hopper the latter is revolved a few
degrees, and this has the effect of giving the delivery of the next
load in another direction, so that the charges of the skip are in
turn distributed over the whole area of the surface. This is
deemed a most essential point in furnace-charging, and it is
not one of the least recommendations of this mechanical system
of furnace-charging that it can give an even feed without any
hand labour whatever. A double hoist has been designed which
has the advantage that if one elevator breaks down the work
of the furnace is not interrupted. In this system two furnaces
are connected at the top by a gantry or bridge, against which,
between the furnaces, two inclined elevators are set, so that
each can serve either furnace. The skips are on wheels and
detachable from the elevator, and are loaded from the ore
pockets at the lower terminal and drawn up on a cradle; as this
reaches the top where the rails on the gantry correspond with
the gauge of the skip or car, the latter is carried by its own
weight down a slight incline to either furnace, discharging its
contents as it passes over the conical mouth. Another advantage
claimed for this system is that the rails of the cradle, when in
its lowest position, correspond with the rails which lie parallel
to the furnaces and run right under the store bins from which
the skip is loaded. The economy to be realized from a furnace
hoist will be in direct proportion to the use made of mechanical
means of feed conveyance. For instance, the store bins in
connexion with such elevators might be economically fed by
suitable conveyors, or the material might be brought in self-unloading
hoppered trucks into conveniently placed bins, ready
to be drawn into the skips.</p>

<p><i>Ropeways.</i>&mdash;A ropeway has been defined as that method of
handling material which consists of drawing buckets on ropes,
and by means of ropes, such buckets being filled with the material
to be handled and being automatically or otherwise discharged.
At what period of history ropeways were first used it is impossible
to say, but the fact that pulley blocks, and even wire ropes, were
known to the ancients, renders a pedigree of 2000 years at least
possible. In more modern days, an old engraving shows a single
ropeway in working order in 1644 in the city of Danzig. This, the
work of Adam Wybe, a Dutch engineer, was a single ropeway in
its simplest form, consisting of an endless rope passing over
pulleys suspended on posts; to the rope were attached a number
of small buckets, which evidently carried earth from a hill outside
the city to the rampart inside the moat. The rope was
probably of hemp. Modern ropeways worked with wire ropes
date from about 1860, when a ropeway was erected in the Harz
Mountains. Since then several systems have been evolved, but
in the main ropeways may be divided into the single and double
rope class.</p>

<p>The ropeway is essentially an intermittent conveyor, the
material being carried in buckets or skips, and practice has proved
it an economical means of handling heavy material. The prime
cost of a ropeway is usually moderate, though of course it varies
with the ground and other local conditions. Working expenses
should be low, because under the supervision of one competent
engineer unskilled labour is quite sufficient. A ropeway may
be carried over ground over which rails could only be laid at
enormous cost. To a certain extent ropeways are independent of
weather conditions, because their working need not be interrupted
even by heavy snowfalls. Their construction is very simple, and
there is little gear to get out of order. Sound workmanship and
good material will ensure a relatively long life. As an instance,
a certain rope in a Spanish ropeway tested new to a breaking
strain of 29½ tons was shown after carrying 160,000 tons (in two
years&rsquo; incessant work) still to possess a breaking strain of 27½ tons.
The power absorbed by a ropeway is relatively moderate, and
under special conditions may be nil. The only demand it makes
on the superficial area of the ground traversed is the small
emplacements of the standards, which in modern ropeways are
few and far between. Wayleaves, or the permission to erect
standards and run the line over private land, may of course
mean an item in the capital outlay. This circumstance may
have checked ropeway construction in Great Britain, but it must
also be borne in mind that a large portion of that country is
comparatively level and well provided with railways. In
building a ropeway it is essential to take as straight a line as
possible, because curves generally necessitate angle stations,
which mean extra capital and working cost. On the other hand,
ground that would be difficult for the railway engineer, such as
steep hills, deep valleys and turbulent streams, has no terror for
the ropeway erector. There is a case of a ropeway of a total
length of 5400 ft. with a total difference in altitude of 2000 ft.; it
is claimed this ground could not be covered by a railway with less
than 15 m. of line graded at 1 in 40.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Perhaps the simplest type of a single rope system is an endless
running rope from which the carriers are suspended, and with
which they move by frictional contact. Or the carriers may be
fixed to this rope and move with it. The ropeway itself would
consist of an endless rope running between two drums, one, known
as the driving drum, being provided with power receiving and
transmitting gear, while the drum at the opposite terminal would
be fitted with tightening gear. The endless rope is carried on suitable
pulleys which themselves are supported on standards or trestles
spaced at intervals varying with the nature of the ground. The
rope runs at an average speed of 4 m. per hour, a speed at which
the bucket or skip can automatically unload itself. In the double
ropeway the carrier runs on a fixed rope, which takes the place of
the rails of a railway. The carrier is fitted with running heads furnished
with grooved steel wheels. The load is borne by a hanger
pivoted from the carrier, and is conveyed along the rail rope by an
endless hauling rope at an average speed of 4 to 6 m. per hour.
The hauling is operated by driving gear at one end, and controlled
by tightening gear at the other end just as in the single rope system.
Double ropeways have been carried in one section over 18 to 20 m.,
and will transport single loads of 6 cwt. to a ton or more.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the single ropeway is not so suitable for heavy
loads and long distances as the double, but in this connexion the
work of Ropeways Limited should be noted, which favours a single
rope system. Their engineer, J. Pearce Roe, introduced multiple
sheaves for supporting the rope at each standard. Thus the rope
may pass over one, two or four sheaves, which are provided with
balance beams that have the advantage of adjusting themselves
to the angle caused by the rope passing over the sheaves, thus
equalizing the pressure over a number of sheaves. A ropeway
erected on this system in Japan spans 4000 yds. of very broken
ground; yet only 17 trestles are used, and as each support is placed
as high as possible, no one is of great height. An altitude of 1130 ft.
is reached in a distance of 1200 yds. The ropeway has a daily
carrying capacity of 60 tons in one direction and of 30 tons in the
other. Another installation on this system, which serves an iron
mine in Spain, spans 6500 yds. of very rough country, so steep that
in many places the sure-footed mule cannot keep on the track.
This ropeway can deal with 85 tons per hour. The greatest distance
covered by this system, on one section, is 7100 yds., or about 4 m.,
and the carrying capacity is 45 tons per hour.</p>

<p>The motive power required for a ropeway will vary with the
conditions. In cases of descending loads the power generated is
sometimes so considerable as to render it available for driving other
machinery, or it may have to be absorbed by some special brake
device. In a ropeway in Japan of 1800 yds., which runs mostly at
an incline of 1 in 1½, the force generated is absorbed by a hydraulic
brake the revolving fan of which drives the water against fixed
vanes which repel and heat it. In this way, 50 h.p. is absorbed
and the speed brought under the control of a hand brake.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Aerial Cableways.</i>&mdash;The aerial cableway is a development of
the ropeway, and is a conveyor capable of hoisting and dumping
at any desired point. The load is carried along a trackway
consisting of a single span of suspended cable, which covers a
comparatively short distance. The trackway may either run in a
more or less horizontal direction, <i>i.e.</i> the terminals may be on the
same level, or it may be inclined at such an angle that the load
will descend by gravity. The trackway or rail rope rests upon
saddles of iron or hard wood on the tops of terminal supports,
usually known as towers. These towers may be constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
either of wood or iron, and if the exigencies of the work render it
desirable, they may be mounted on trolleys and rails, in which
case the cableway is rendered portable, and can be moved about,
sometimes a great advantage in excavating work. The motive
power may be either steam, gas, or electricity. The motor is
situated in what is termed the head tower, which is sometimes a
little higher than the other or tail tower. Sometimes, but not
frequently, the latter is also fitted with a motor. The span
between the two towers sometimes extends to 2000 ft., but this
is exceptional. Very heavy loads are dealt with, sometimes as
much as 8 tons in a single load. The load, which may be carried
in a skip or a tray, is borne by an apparatus called the carrier,
which is a modification of a running head, consisting of pulleys
and blocks and running along the main cable or trackway. The
carrier is also fitted with pulleys or guides for the dump line.
The carrier is drawn along the main cable by an endless or
hauling rope which passes from the carrier over the head tower
and is wound several times round the drum of the winding engine
to secure frictional hold, then back over the head tower, to the
tail tower, returning to the rear end of the carrier. The hoisting
rope passes from the engine to the fall block for raising the load.
The dump line comes from the other side of the winding engine
drum and passes to a smaller block attached to the rear end of the
skip or tray. The whole weight of the skip is borne by the
hoisting rope, while the dump line comes in slack, but at the
same rate of speed. Whenever it is desired to dump the load,
the dump line is shifted to a section of the drum having a
slightly larger diameter, and being thus drawn in at a higher rate
of speed the load is discharged. The engine is then reversed, and
the carriage brought back for the next load.</p>

<p>This is in outline the mode of operating all cableways. This
appliance has rendered great service as a labour saver in navvying,
quarrying and mining work; in placer-mining, for instance,
cableways have been found very useful when fitted with a self-filling
drag bucket, which will take the place of a great number of
hands. Cableways can be worked at a great speed, but a good
mean speed would be 500 to 750 ft. for conveying and 200 to 300
ft. for hoisting. A cableway used in excavating work in Chicago
was credited with a capacity of 400 to 600 cub. yds. per day at a
total cost of 2d. per yard, including labour, coal, oil, waste, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Coaling Ships at Sea.</i>&mdash;In the coaling of ships at sea the cableway
has rendered great service. The conditions under which
this operation has to be carried out present many difficulties,
especially in rough water. One of the chief obstacles is the
maintenance of the necessary tension on the cable used in
conveying the coal from the collier to the ship. The first test in
coaling ships at sea, made by the British admiralty, took place in
1890 in the Atlantic at a point 500 m. south of the Azores in
water 2000 fathoms deep. Ten ships of war were coaled, each
vessel taking enough coal to enable it to steam back to Torbay,
1800 m. away. In this case the collier was lashed alongside the
battleship it was feeding, thick fenders being interposed to
prevent damage, but nevertheless as the colliers got light they
pitched considerably, and one or two sustained dents in their
sides. The ships did not roll, being kept bows-on to the swell,
which became heavy before the coaling was completed. The
coal was taken in by derricks at the main deck ports. It is
clear that had the sea been really rough coaling in this fashion
would have been impossible.</p>

<p>The most practicable method of coaling at sea yet devised
is the marine cableway of Spencer Miller, which has been tried
with some success in the American navy. It is intended for use
between vessels 350 to 500 ft. apart. The ship being coaled
takes the collier in tow, steaming at the rate of 4 to 8 knots;
it has been found that a speed of five knots in moderately rough
water will keep the cableway taut and maintain a sufficient
distance between the crafts. The collier is fitted with an engine
having double cylinders and double friction drums, which is
placed just abaft the foremast. A steel rope ¾ in. in diameter
is led from one drum over a pulley at the mast head and thence
to a pulley at the head of shear-poles on the vessel being coaled,
and brought back to the other drum. The engine moves in the
same direction all the time and keeps on winding in both the
strands of the conveying rope. Should the two vessels increase
the distance between them during the operation of conveying
the coal bags, of which two, weighing 420 &#8468; each, may be
fastened to the carrier, the extra rope called for is obtained by
slipping the upper strand from the drum; this increases the
speed of the upper cable. On the other hand should the distance
between the vessels be reduced, this operation is reversed, the
speed of the upper strand being reduced. To keep the carriage
steady on its return empty, a rope, known as the sea-anchor
line, is stretched above the two strands of the conveyor line,
and under a pulley on the carriage. This cable is attached to
the vessel, resting on a saddle on the shear head, whence it leads
through the carriage over pulleys at the head of the foremast
and mainmast of the collier, running on astern several hundred
feet into the sea. A drag or sea-anchor, usually made of canvas
and cone-shaped, is attached to the end of this rope. This
anchor is used to support the empty carriage on its return to
the collier. The diameter of the cone&rsquo;s base is graduated to the
speed of the vessels. Thus in a smooth-water test, with a ship
steaming at 6 knots, one 7 ft. in diameter was used, while the
same anchor answered its purpose very well with a ship doing
5 knots in rough water.</p>

<p>The results given by this system of coaling at sea are relatively
satisfactory. Tests made in the United States navy showed
that 20 to 25 tons of coal per hour could be delivered by a collier
to a war-vessel during a moderate gale. As the ship was under
steam all the time and consumed 3 to 4 tons of coal per hour,
the balance of the coal bunkered amounted to between 16 and
20 tons per hour, or say 384 tons in 24 hours. It has been suggested
that under service conditions the speed of the towing
vessel might be increased to 8 or 10 knots an hour; this would
of course increase the coal consumption unless the collier proceeded
under her own steam. But in such a case the space
between the two crafts might be diminished, which would have
the effect of causing the cable to sag and of stopping the work,
since the conveyor cable to act properly must be kept taut.
In Great Britain the Temperley Transporter Company have
taken up this method of coaling at sea, working in collaboration
with Spencer Miller, and have introduced several improvements
in detail. Their system has been tried by the British admiralty.</p>

<p>The coaling of a large vessel by this appliance has the advantage
of economizing hand labour. One man is required to work the
hoist on the collier, while 20 men will be in the hold filling the
bags and delivering them to the deck, where 15 or so will transfer
the bags to the lift. One or two men suffice for the overhead
work; their station is in the trestle trees. On board the receiving
ship a few men will be stationed at the shear head to empty the
bags into a canvas shoot, and then return them, while there will
be the usual force of bunker trimmers. A ton of coal per minute
has been transferred from the collier to the vessel, but for this
capacity the ships must not be too far apart, else the rope would
not remain taut under such loads. During the Russo-Japanese
War, many of the Russian battleships were coaled by means
of aerial cableways. The coaling of vessels in this manner seems
a success, but it would be desirable to increase the carrying
capacity of the cableway or to duplicate the installations.</p>

<p><i>Telpherage.</i>&mdash;A telpher ropeway or cableway may be defined
as a ropeway or cableway worked and controlled electrically,
only a rail rope being required besides the live rail or wire from
which the electric current is taken. Telpherage was devised
by Professor Fleeming Jenkin in 1881, and developed by him
in conjunction with Professors W. E. Ayrton and J. Perry.
The telpher itself consists of a light two-wheeled truck, carrying
the driving motors, which, to avoid gearing or other complicated
mechanism, are usually coupled directly to the axles of the
telpher. Thus the telpher is a self-propelled electric carrier
running on a mono-rail, which, according to the conditions, may
be a steel rail or a steel cable. From the telpher are suspended
carriers which can be adapted to any kind of material. In many
cases the whole load may be suspended from the telpher, or the
load, especially if of some length, may be supported at one end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
by a telpher, and at the other end by what is known as a trailer,
or again, two telphers may be installed, one at each end of the
load. The telpher carries a small trolley sheave or bow which
serves to collect the current from a trolley wire stretched a little
above the rail. Frequently the telpher is accompanied by an
attendant who manipulates it, but by dividing the trolley wire
into sections any system of telpherage may be constructed to
work automatically, and by switching off the current from the
section in which the telpher is required to stop it can be brought
to a standstill at any required point. The speed of the telpher
may be readily regulated by the introduction of a resistance
between any section of the line and the supply of electricity.
The speed may be high, as much as 1500 ft. per minute over the
straight portions of the line, but slackened at curves and loading
stations, or when approaching a terminus. The required power
may be obtained from the mains of an ordinary electric supply
with either direct or alternating current, but the former is
preferable. The mean expenditure of power in a working day
is said to average (including electrical hoisting) 1 H.P. per ton
of average load.</p>

<p>The uses of telpherage are many and various. In factories
and warehouses, where the buildings are scattered, it has been
installed with excellent results. Being essentially an overhead
system, there is a saving of floor space, the ground not being
obstructed by trucks or trolleys. The same reasons which
render ropeways an economical means of handling such material
as coal, ore, stone, slate, &amp;c., between the mine or quarry and
the rail or barge, may be adduced in favour of telpherage. For
the unloading of railway trucks in a crowded goods-yard it
is undoubtedly applicable. Any kind of tipping or hoisting
operations can be automatically effected by its aid, and any
sort of grab may be used in dealing with such materials as sand,
clay or gravel. Telpherage is clearly a labour-saving method
of handling materials, but of course the exact conditions under
which any system is to be used need careful study, while the
economy to be effected by the installation of a telpher line must
to a great extent depend upon the available supply of electrical
energy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONVOCATION<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (Lat. <i>convocatio</i>, a calling together), an
assembly of persons met together in answer to a summons. The
term is more usually applied in a restricted sense to assemblies
of the clergy or of the graduates of certain universities.</p>

<p>In the American Protestant Episcopal Church a convocation
is a voluntary deliberative conference of the clergy; it has no
legislative function, and like the convocation of a university,
assembles primarily to discuss matters of common interest.</p>

<p>In England the name &ldquo;convocation&rdquo; is specifically given to
an assembly of the spirituality of the realm of England, which is
summoned by the metropolitan archbishops of Canterbury and of
York respectively, within their ecclesiastical provinces, pursuant
to a royal writ, whenever the parliament of the realm is
summoned, and which is also continued or discharged, as the
case may be, whenever the parliament is prorogued or dissolved.
These assemblies consist of two Houses, an upper and lower.
In the upper house sit the archbishops and bishops, and in the
lower the deans and archdeacons of every cathedral, the provost
of Eton College, with one proctor elected by each cathedral
chapter and two by the beneficed clergy in each diocese in the
province of Canterbury (in the province of York two proctors are
elected by each archdeacon), with a prolocutor at their head.
When and how this convocation originated is not historically
clear. This much is known from authentic records, that the
present constitution of the convocation of the prelates and clergy
of the province of Canterbury was recognized as early as in the
eleventh year of the reign of Edward I. (1283) as its normal
constitution; and that in extorting that recognition from the
crown, which the clergy accomplished by refusing to attend
unless summoned in lawful manner (<i>debito modo</i>) through their
metropolitan, the clergy of the province of Canterbury taught the
laity the possibility of maintaining the freedom of the nation
against the encroachments of the royal power. It had been a
provision of the Anglo-Saxon period, the origin of which is
generally referred to the council of Clovesho (747), that the
possessions of the church should be exempt from taxation by the
secular power, and that it should be left to the benevolence of the
clergy to grant such subsidies to the crown from the endowments
of their churches as they should agree to in their own assemblies.
It may be inferred, however, from the language of the various
writs issued by the crown for the collection of the &ldquo;aids&rdquo; voted
by the <i>Commune Concilium</i> of the realm in the reign of Henry III.,
that the clergy were unable to maintain the exemption of church
property from being taxed to those &ldquo;aids&rdquo; during that king&rsquo;s
reign; and it was not until some years had elapsed of the reign of
Edward I. that the spirituality succeeded in vindicating their
constitutional privilege of voting in their own assemblies their
free gifts or &ldquo;benevolences,&rdquo; and in insisting on the crown
observing the lawful form of convoking those assemblies through
the metropolitan of each province.</p>

<p>The form of the royal writ, which it is customary to issue in the
present day to the metropolitan of each province, is identical in
its purport with the writ issued by the crown in 1283 to the
metropolitan of the province of Canterbury, after the clergy
of that province had refused to meet at Northampton in the
previous year, because they had not been summoned in lawful
manner; whilst the mandates issued by the metropolitans in
pursuance of the royal writs, and the citations issued by the
bishops in pursuance of the mandates of their respective metropolitans,
are identical in their purport and form with those used in
summoning the convocation of 1283, which met at the New
Temple in the city of London, and voted a &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; to
the crown, as having been convoked in lawful manner. The
existing constitution of the convocation of the province of
Canterbury&mdash;and the same observation will apply to that of the
province of York&mdash;in respect of its comprising representatives of
the chapters and of the beneficed clergy, in addition to the
bishops and other dignitaries of the church, would thus appear
to be of even more ancient date than the existing constitution of
the parliament of the realm.</p>

<p>From this period down to the eleventh year of the reign of
Edward III. there were continual contests between the spirituality
of the realm and the crown,&mdash;the spirituality
contending for their constitutional right to vote their
<span class="sidenote">Contest between spirituality and crown.</span>
subsidies in their provincial convocations; the crown,
on the other hand, insisting on the immediate attendance
of the clergy in parliament. The resistance of the
clergy to the innovation of the &ldquo;praemunientes&rdquo; clause had so
far prevailed in the reign of Edward II. that the crown consented
to summon the clergy to parliament through their metropolitans,
and a special form of provincial writ was for that purpose framed;
but the clergy protested against this writ, and the struggle was
maintained between the spirituality and the crown until 1337
(11 Edward III.), when the crown reverted to the ancient
practice of commanding the metropolitans to call together their
clergy in their provincial assemblies, where their subsidies were
voted in the manner as accustomed before the &ldquo;praemunientes&rdquo;
clause was introduced. The &ldquo;praemunientes&rdquo; clause, however,
was continued in the parliamentary writs issued to the several
bishops of both provinces, whilst the bishops were permitted to
neglect at their pleasure the execution of the writs.</p>

<p>The history of the convocation of the province of Canterbury,
as at present constituted, is full of stirring incidents, and it
resolves itself readily into five periods. The first
period, by which is meant the first period which dates
<span class="sidenote">Five characteristic periods.</span>
from an epoch of authentic history, is the period of its
greatest freedom, but not of its greatest activity. It
extends from the reign of Edward I. (1283) to that of Henry VIII.
The second period is the period of its greatest activity and of its
greatest usefulness, and it extends from the twenty-fifth year of
the reign of Henry VIII. to the reign of Charles II. The third
period extends from the fifteenth year of the reign of Charles II.
(1664) to the reign of George I. This was a period of turbulent
activity and little usefulness, and the anarchy of the lower house
of convocation during this period created a strong prejudice
against the revival of convocation in the mind of the laity. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
fourth period extends from the third year of the reign of George
I. (1716) to the fifteenth year of the reign of Queen Victoria.
This was a period of torpid inactivity, during which it was
customary for convocation to be summoned and to meet <i>pro
forma</i>, and to be continued and prorogued indefinitely. The
fifth period may be considered to have commenced in the fifteenth
year of the reign of Queen Victoria (1852).</p>

<p>During the first of the five periods above mentioned, it would
appear from the records preserved at Lambeth and at York that
the metropolitans frequently convened congregations
(so called) of their clergy without the authority of a
<span class="sidenote">First period.</span>
royal writ, which were constituted precisely as the
convocations were constituted, when the metropolitans were
commanded to call their clergy together pursuant to a writ from
the crown. As soon, however, as King Henry VIII. had obtained
from the clergy their acknowledgment of the supremacy of the
crown in all ecclesiastical causes, he constrained the spirituality
to declare, by what has been termed the Act of Submission on
behalf of the clergy, that the convocation &ldquo;is, always has been,
and ought to be summoned by authority of a royal writ&rdquo;; and
this declaration was embodied in a statute of the realm (25 Henry
VIII. c. 19), which further enacted that the convocation &ldquo;should
thenceforth make no provincial canons, constitutions or ordinances
without the royal assent and licence.&rdquo; The spirituality was
thus more closely incorporated than heretofore in the body
politic of the realm, seeing that no deliberations on its part can
take place unless the crown has previously granted its licence for
such deliberations. It had been already provided during this
period by 8 Henry VI. c. 1, that the prelates and other clergy,
with their servants and attendants, when called to the convocation
pursuant to the king&rsquo;s writ, should enjoy the same liberty
and defence in coming, tarrying and returning as the magnates
and the commons of the realm enjoy when summoned to the
king&rsquo;s parliament.</p>

<p>The second period, which dates from 1533 to 1664, has been
distinguished by four important assemblies of the spirituality
of the realm in pursuance of a royal writ&mdash;the two
first of which occurred in the reign of Edward VI.,
<span class="sidenote">Second period.</span>
the third in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and the
fourth in the reign of Charles II. The two earliest of these
convocations were summoned to complete the work of the
reformation of the Church of England, which had been begun
by Henry VIII.; the third was called together to reconstruct
that work, which had been marred on the accession of Mary (the
consort of Philip II. of Spain), whilst the fourth was summoned
to re-establish the Church of England, the framework of which
had been demolished during the great rebellion. On all of these
occasions the convocations worked hand in hand with the
parliament of the realm under a licence and with the assent
of the crown. Meanwhile the convocation of 1603 had framed
a body of canons for the governance of the clergy. Another
convocation requires a passing notice, in which certain canons
were drawn up in 1640, but by reason of an irregularity in the
proceedings of this convocation (chiefly, on the ground that
its sessions were continued for some time after the parliament
of the realm had been dissolved), its canons are not held to have
any binding obligation on the clergy. The convocations had
up to this time maintained their liberty of voting the subsidies
of the clergy in the form of &ldquo;benevolences&rdquo; separate and apart
from the &ldquo;aids&rdquo; granted by the laity in parliament, and one
of the objections taken to the proceedings of the convocation
of 1640 was that it had continued to sit and to vote its subsidies
to the crown after the parliament itself had been dissolved.
It is not, therefore, surprising on the restoration of the monarchy
in 1661 that the spirituality was not anxious to retain the liberty
of taxing itself apart from the laity, seeing that its ancient liberty
was likely to prove of questionable advantage to it. It voted,
however, a benevolence to the crown on the occasion of its first
assembling in 1661 after the restoration of King Charles II.,
and it continued so to do until 1664, when an arrangement was
made between Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor Hyde,
under which the spirituality silently waived its long-asserted
right of voting its own subsidies to the crown, and submitted itself
thenceforth to be assessed to the &ldquo;aids&rdquo; directly granted to the
<span class="sidenote">Sheldonian compact.</span>
crown by parliament. An act was accordingly passed
by the parliament in the following year 1665, entitled
An act to grant a Royal Aid unto the King&rsquo;s Majesty,
to which aid the clergy were assessed by the commissioners
named in the statute without any objection being
raised on their part or behalf,<a name="FnAnchor_1c" id="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> there being a proviso that in so
contributing the clergy should be relieved of the liability to pay
two subsidies out of four, which had been voted by them in the
convocation of a previous year. In consequence of this practical
renunciation of their separate <i>status</i>, as regards their liability
to taxation, the clergy have assumed and enjoyed in common
with the laity the right of voting at the election of members of
the House of Commons, in virtue of their ecclesiastical freeholds.</p>

<p>The most important and the last work of the convocation
during this second period of its activity was the revision of the
Book of Common Prayer which was completed in the latter
part of 1661.</p>

<p>The Revolution in 1688 is the most important epoch in the
third period of the history of the synodical proceedings of the
spirituality, when the convocation of Canterbury,
having met in 1689 in pursuance of a royal writ,
<span class="sidenote">Third period.</span>
obtained a licence under the great seal, to prepare
certain alterations in the liturgy and in the canons, and to
deliberate on the reformation of the ecclesiastical courts. A
feeling, however, of panic seems to have come over the Lower
House, which took up a position of violent antagonism to the
Upper House. This circumstance led to the prorogation of
the convocation and to its subsequent discharge without any
practical fruit resulting from the king&rsquo;s licence. Ten years
elapsed during which the convocation was prorogued from time
to time without any meeting of its members for business being
allowed. The next convocation which was permitted to meet
for business, in 1700, was marked by great turbulence and insubordination
on the part of the members of the Lower House,
who refused to recognize the authority of the archbishop to
prorogue their sessions. This controversy was kept up until
the discharge of the convocation took place concurrently with
the dissolution of the parliament in the autumn of that year.
The proceedings of the Lower House in this convocation were
disfigured by excesses which were clearly violations of the
constitutional order of the convocation. The Lower House
refused to take notice of the archbishop&rsquo;s schedule of prorogation,
and adjourned itself by its own authority, and upon the demise
of the crown it disputed the fact of its sessions having expired,
and as parliament was to continue for a short time, prayed
that its sessions might be continued as a part of the parliament
under the &ldquo;praemunientes&rdquo; clause. The next convocation was
summoned in the first year of Queen Anne, when the Lower
House, under the leadership of Dean Aldrich, its prolocutor,
<span class="sidenote">Claim of Lower House to sit independently.</span>
challenged the right of the archbishop to prorogue it,
and presented a petition to the queen, praying her
majesty to call the question into her own presence.
The question was thereupon examined by the queen&rsquo;s
council, when the right of the president to prorogue
both houses of convocation by a schedule of prorogation was held
to be proved, and further, that it could not be altered except
by an act of parliament. During the remaining years of the
reign of Queen Anne the two Houses of convocation were engaged
either in internecine strife, or in censuring sermons or books, as
teaching latitudinarian or heretical doctrines; and, when it had
been assembled concurrently with parliament on the accession
of King George I., a great breach was before long created between
the two houses by the Bangorian controversy. Dr Hoadly,
bishop of Bangor, having preached a sermon before the king,
in the Royal Chapel at St James&rsquo;s Palace in 1717, against the
principles and practice of the nonjurors, which had been printed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
by the king&rsquo;s command, the Lower House, which was offended
by the sermon and had also been offended by a treatise on the
<span class="sidenote">Bangorian controversy.</span>
same subject published by Dr Hoadly in the previous
year, lost no time in representing the sermon to the
Upper House, and in calling for its condemnation. A
controversy thereupon arose between the two houses
which was kept up with untiring energy by the Lower House,
until the convocation was prorogued in 1717 in pursuance of a
royal writ; from which time until 1861 no licence from the crown
was granted to convocation to proceed to business. During
this period, which may be regarded as the fourth distinguishing
period in the history of the convocations of the Church of England,
<span class="sidenote">Fourth period.</span>
it was usual for a few members of the convocation to
meet when first summoned with every new parliament,
in pursuance of the royal writ, for the Lower House
to elect a prolocutor, and for both houses to vote an address
to the crown, after which the convocation was prorogued from
time to time, pursuant to royal writs, and ultimately discharged
when the parliament was dissolved. There were, however,
several occasions between 1717 and 1741 when the convocation
of the province of Canterbury transacted certain matters, by
way of consultation, which did not require any licence from the
crown, and there was a short period in its session of 1741 when
there was a probability of its being allowed to resume its deliberative
functions, as the Lower House had consented to obey
the president&rsquo;s schedule of prorogation; but the Lower House
having declined to receive a communication from the Upper
House, the convocation was forthwith prorogued, from which
time until the middle of the 19th century the convocation was
not permitted by the crown to enjoy any opportunity even for
consultation. The spirituality at last aroused itself from its
long repose in 1852, and on this occasion the Upper House took
the lead. The active spirit of the movement was Samuel Wilberforce,
<span class="sidenote">Fifth period.</span>
bishop of Oxford, but the master mind was
Henry Phillpotts, bishop of Exeter. On the convocation
assembling several petitions were presented to
both houses, praying them to take steps to procure from the
crown the necessary licence for their meeting for the despatch
of business, and an address to the Upper House was brought
up from the Lower House, calling the attention of the Upper
House to the reasonableness of the prayer of the various petitions.
After some discussion the Upper House, influenced mainly by
the argument of Henry, bishop of Exeter, consented to receive
the address of the Lower House, and the convocation was thereupon
prorogued, shortly after which it was discharged concurrently
with the dissolution of parliament. On the assembling
of the next convocation of the province of Canterbury, no royal
writ of exoneration having been sent by the crown to the metropolitan,
the sessions of the convocation were continued for
several days; and from this time forth convocation may be
considered to have resumed its action as a consultative body,
whilst it has also been permitted on more than one occasion
to exercise its functions as a deliberative body. In 1865, under
licence from the crown, the Convocations of Canterbury and
York framed new canons in place of the 36th, 37th, 38th and
40th canons of 1603, and amended the 62nd and 102nd canons
in 1888. In 1872 convocation was empowered by letters of
business from the crown to frame resolutions on the subject of
public worship, which resolutions were afterwards incorporated
in the Act of Uniformity Amendment Act 1872.</p>

<p>As a deliberative body, convocation has done much useful
work, but it suffers considerably from its unrepresentative
nature. The non-beneficed clergy still remain without the
franchise, but the establishment of Houses of Laymen (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Laymen, Houses of</a></span>) for both provinces has, to a certain extent,
secured the co-operation of the lay element. Several attempts
have been made to promote legislation to enable the convocations
to reform their constitutions and to enable them to unite for
special purposes; in 1905 a bill was introduced into the House of
Lords. It did not, however, get beyond a first reading. In 1896
a departure was made in holding joint sessions of both convocations,
in conjunction with the two Houses of Laymen, for consultative
purposes. This body is now termed the Representative
Church Council, and it adopted a Constitution in November 1905.
All formal business is transacted in the separate convocations.
It is usual for convocation to meet three times a year.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The order of convening the convocation of the province of Canterbury
is as follows. A writ issues from the crown, addressed to the
metropolitan archbishop of Canterbury, commanding him &ldquo;by
reason of certain difficult and urgent affairs concerning us, the
security and defence of our Church of England, and the peace and
tranquillity, public good and defence of our kingdom, and our
subjects of the same, to call together with all convenient speed, and
in lawful manner, the several bishops of the province of Canterbury,
and deans of the cathedral churches, and also the archdeacons,
chapters and colleges, and the whole clergy of every diocese of the
said province, to appear before the said metropolitan in the cathedral
church of St Paul, London, on a certain day, or elsewhere, as shall
seem most expedient, to treat of, agree to and conclude upon the
premises and other things, which to them shall then at the same place
be more clearly explained on our behalf.&rdquo; In case the metropolitical
see of Canterbury should be vacant, the writ of the crown is addressed
to the dean and chapter of the metropolitical church of
Canterbury in similar terms, as being the guardians of the spiritualities
of the see during a vacancy. Thereupon the metropolitan,
or, as the case may be, the dean and chapter of the metropolitical
church, issue a mandate to the bishop of London, as dean of the
province, and if the bishopric of London should be vacant, then to
the bishop of Winchester as subdean, which embodies the royal writ,
and directs the bishop to cause all the bishops of the province to be
cited, and through them the deans of the cathedral and collegiate
churches, and the archdeacons and other dignitaries of churches, and
each chapter by one, and the clergy of each diocese by two sufficient
proctors, to appear before the metropolitan or his commissary, or,
as the case may be, before the dean and chapter of the metropolitical
church or their commissary, in the chapter-house of the cathedral
church of St Paul, London, if that place be named in the mandate,
or elsewhere, with continuation and prorogation of days next
following, if that should be necessary, to treat upon arduous and
weighty affairs, which shall concern the state and welfare, public
good and defence of this kingdom and the subjects thereof, to be
then and there seriously laid before them, and to give their good
counsel and assistance on the said affairs, and to consent to such
things as shall happen to be wholesomely ordered and appointed
by their common advisement, for the honour of God and the good
of the church.</p>

<p>The provincial dean, or the subdean, as the case may be, thereupon
issues a citation to the several bishops of the province, which
embodies the mandate of the metropolitan or of the dean and chapter
of the metropolitical church, as the case may be, and admonishes
them to appear, and to cite and admonish their clergy, as specified
in the metropolitical mandate, to appear at the time and place
mentioned in the mandate. The bishops thereupon either summon
directly the clergy of their respective dioceses to appear before them
or their commissaries to elect two proctors, or they send a citation
to their archdeacons, according to the custom of the diocese, directing
them to summon the clergy of their respective archdeaconries
to elect a proctor. The practice of each diocese in this matter is
the law of the convocation, and the practice varies indefinitely as
regards the election of proctors to represent the beneficed clergy.
As regards the deans, the bishops send special writs to them to
appear in person, and to cause their chapters to appear severally by
one proctor. Writs also go to every archdeacon, and on the day
named in the royal writ, which is always the day next following
that named in the writ to summon the parliament, the convocation
assembles in the place named in the archbishop&rsquo;s mandate. Thereupon,
after the Litany has been sung or said, and a Latin sermon
preached by a preacher appointed by the metropolitan, the clergy
are praeconized or summoned by name to appear before the metropolitan
or his commissary; after which the clergy of the Lower
House are directed to withdraw and elect a prolocutor to be presented
to the metropolitan for his approbation. The convocation thus
constituted resolves itself at its next meeting into two houses, and
it is in a fit state to proceed to business.</p>

<p>The constitution of the convocation of the province of York differs
slightly from that of the convocation of the province of Canterbury,
as each archdeaconry is represented by two proctors, precisely as
in parliament formerly under the Praemunientes clause.</p>

<p>There are some anomalies in the diocesan returns of the two
convocations, but in all such matters the <i>consuetudo</i> of the diocese
is the governing rule.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CONVOLVULACEAE,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> a botanical natural order belonging to
the series Tubiflorae of the sympetalous group of Dicotyledons.
It contains about 40 genera with more than 1000 species, and is
found in all parts of the world except the coldest, but is especially
well developed in tropical Asia and tropical America. The most
characteristic members of the order are twining plants with
generally smooth heart-shaped leaves and large showy white or
purple flowers, as, for instance, the greater bindweed of English
hedges, <i>Calystegia sepium</i>, and many species of the genus <i>Ipomaea</i>,
the largest of the order, including the &ldquo;convolvulus major&rdquo; of
gardens, and morning glory. The creeping or trailing type is a
common one, as in the English bindweed (<i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>),
which has also a tendency to climb, and <i>Calystegia Soldanella</i>,
the sea-bindweed, the long creeping stem of which forms a sand-binder
on English seashores; a widespread and efficient tropical
sand-binder is <i>Ipomaea Pes-Caprae</i>. One of the commonest
tropical weeds, <i>Evolvulus alsinoides</i>, has slender, long-trailing
stems with small leaves and flowers. In hot dry districts such
as Arabia and north-east tropical Africa, genera have been
developed with a low, much-branched, dense, shrubby habit,
with small hairy leaves and very small flowers. An exceptional
type in the order is represented by <i>Humbertia</i>, a native of
Madagascar, which forms a large tree. The dodder (<i>q.v.</i>) is a
genus (<i>Cuscuta</i>) of leafless parasites with slender thread-like
twining stems. The flowers stand singly in the leaf-axils or form
few or many flowered cymose inflorescences; the flowers are
sometimes crowded into small heads. The bracts are usually
scale-like, but sometimes foliaceous, as for instance in <i>Calystegia</i>,
where they are large and envelop the calyx.</p>

<p>The parts of the flower are in fives in calyx, corolla and stamens,
followed by two carpels which unite to form a superior ovary.
The sepals, which are generally free, show much variation in size,
shape and covering, and afford valuable characters for the distinction
of genera or sub-genera. The corolla is generally funnel-shaped,
more rarely bell-shaped or tubular; the outer face is
often marked out in longitudinal areas, five well-defined areas
tapering from base to apex, and marked with longitudinal striae
corresponding to the middle of the petals, and alternating with
five non-striated weaker triangular areas; in the bud the latter
are folded inwards, the stronger areas being exposed and showing
a twist to the right. The slender filaments of the stamens vary
widely, often in the same flower; the anthers are linear to
ovate in shape, attached at the back to the filament, and open
lengthwise. Some importance attaches to the form of the
pollen grains; the two principal forms are ellipsoidal with
longitudinal bands forming the <i>Convolvulus</i>-type, and a spherical
form with a spiny surface known as the <i>Ipomaea</i>-type. The
ovary is generally two-chambered, with two inverted ovules
standing side by side at the inner angle of each chamber. The
style is simple or branched, and the stigma is linear, capitate or
globose in form; these variations afford means for distinguishing
the different genera. The fruit is usually a capsule opening by
valves; the seeds, where four are developed, are each shaped like
the quadrant of a sphere; the seed-coat is smooth, or sometimes
warty or hairy; the embryo is large with generally broad, folded,
notched or bilobed cotyledons surrounded by a horny endosperm.
<i>Cuscuta</i> has a thread-like, spirally twisted embryo with no trace
of cotyledons.</p>

<p>The large showy flowers are visited by insects for the honey
which is secreted by a ring-like disk below the ovary; large-flowered
species of <i>Ipomaea</i> with narrow tubes are adapted for the
visits of honey-seeking birds.</p>

<p>The largest genus, <i>Ipomaea</i>, has about 400 species distributed
throughout the warmer parts of the earth. <i>Convolvulus</i> has
about 150 to 200 species, mainly in temperate climates; the
genus is principally developed in the Mediterranean area and
western Asia. <i>Cuscuta</i> contains nearly 100 species in the warmer
and temperate regions; two are native in Britain.</p>

<p>The tubers of <i>Ipomaea Batatas</i> are rich in starch and sugar, and,
as the &ldquo;sweet potato,&rdquo; form one of the most widely distributed
foods in the warmer parts of the earth. Several members of the
order are used medicinally for the strong purging properties of the

with, from Lat. <i>cum</i>, with, and <i>via</i>, way; &ldquo;convey&rdquo; has the
same ultimate origin [see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conveyance</a></span>], neither word being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
connected, as has sometimes been supposed, with Lat. <i>convehere</i>,
to carry together), a verb and noun now almost exclusively
used in military and naval parlance. As a verb it signifies in the
first instance to accompany or to escort; and in the 17th century
we even hear of cavalry &ldquo;convoying&rdquo; infantry, but its meaning
was soon complicated by the growing use of the word &ldquo;convey&rdquo;
in the sense of &ldquo;to carry,&rdquo; and as the usual task of an escort was
that of accompanying and protecting vehicles containing supplies,
the noun &ldquo;convoy&rdquo; (Fr. <i>convoi</i>) was introduced and has thenceforward
in land warfare meant a train of vehicles containing
stores for the use of troops and its guard or escort. Sometimes
even the word is found in the meaning of the train of vehicles
without implying that there is an escort, so far has the original
meaning become obscured; but the idea of military protection is
always present, whether this protection is given by a separate
escort or provided by the weapons of the drivers themselves.</p>

<p>In naval warfare the term is used to describe a method
adopted for defending merchant ships against capture. It was
usually applied to the vessels to be protected&mdash;as for example
&ldquo;the Baltic convoy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Captain Montray&rsquo;s convoy.&rdquo; Until
the 17th century the English term was &ldquo;to waft&rdquo; and the
warship employed to guard the traders on their way was called
&ldquo;a wafter.&rdquo; The practice of sailing in convoy for mutual
protection was common in the middle ages, when all ships were
more or less armed and the war vessel was not entirely differentiated
from the trader. Thus the ships of the great German
confederation of cities known as the Hanseatic League were
required to sail in convoy. So were the six trading squadrons
which sailed yearly from Venice. The masters of all the vessels
were required to obey the authority of an officer who had the
general command. In the 16th century the Spanish trade with
America was compelled by law to sail in convoys (<i>flotas</i>), in order
to avoid the danger of capture by pirates to which single ships
were exposed. In the 17th and 18th centuries the use of convoy
was universal. Dutch, French or British ships were collected at
a rendezvous, and were accompanied by warships till they reached
the point at which they were compelled to separate in order to
go to their various destinations. The main danger was near the
enemy&rsquo;s ports. An example of the way the duty was discharged
may be found in the Newfoundland convoy. They sailed from
England under the direction of a naval officer and the protection
of his ships, commonly a forty- or fifty-gun ship with a smaller
vessel in attendance. The convoy sailed to the banks of
Newfoundland. When they had filled up with stock fish, they
were escorted across the Atlantic by the same officer. He
accompanied those of them bound to the Mediterranean to the
port of Leghorn, and, when they had unloaded and reloaded, saw
them home. All cases were not so simple. The ships engaged in
the East and West India trade, for instance, sailed together. In
the Channel they were protected by the main strength of the
fleet. When beyond the Scilly Islands they were left to the care
of a smaller force, and continued together till in the neighbourhood
of Madeira, when they separated. Convoys were subject to
attack in two forms, by strong squadrons which overpowered the
guard, and by privateers, corsairs and isolated cruisers. This
latter peril was much increased in the case of British commerce by
the reluctance of the merchant captains to obey the naval officers.
They were very much inclined to separate from the convoy as
they approached their destination in the hope of forestalling
rivals. As a natural consequence they were frequently captured
by hostile privateers. French naval officers had authority and
large powers of punishment over merchant skippers. The British
naval officers had not. In 1803-34, on the renewal of the war with
France, the British government saw the necessity for regulating
convoy more strictly than had hitherto been the case. It
therefore passed &ldquo;an act for the better protection of the trade of
the United Kingdom during the present hostilities with France.&rdquo;
By this act (the 43rd Geo. III. Cap. 57) all vessels not exempted
by special licence were required to sail in convoy and to conform
to strict regulations, under penalties of £1000 (or, when the goods
included government stores, of £1500) and the loss of all claim to
insurance in case of capture.</p>
<div class="author">(D. H.)</div>

<p>The object of convoying is to attach an official public character
to the convoyed ships, <i>i.e.</i> a sort of assimilation of them to
the escorting ship or ships of war. Thus European states and
jurists hold that the declaration of the commander of the convoy,
that there is no contraband of war on board the convoyed ships,
pledges the national good faith, and must be assumed to be
correct in the same way as it is assumed that the convoy itself is
carrying no contraband of war. Great Britain has never taken
this view. Down to 1907 she had maintained that it is materially
impossible for any neutral state to exercise the necessary supervision
to secure absolute accuracy of the ship&rsquo;s papers. Number
29, however, of the instructions given by the government to
the British plenipotentiaries at the Hague Conference of 1907
stated that &ldquo;H.M. government would ... be glad to see the
right of search limited in every practicable way, <i>e.g.</i> by the adoption
of a system of consular certificates declaring the absence of
contraband from the cargo....&rdquo; As the greater includes the
smaller, we may assume that, if a consular certificate might
suffice to exempt from the exercise of search, the state guarantee
of a convoy would certainly suffice. The London Convention
on the Laws and Customs of Naval War has laid down the rules
as to convoys in the following terms:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Neutral vessels under national convoy are exempt from search.
The commander of a convoy gives, in writing, at the request of the
commander of a belligerent warship, all information as to the
character of the vessels and their cargoes, which could be obtained
by search.&mdash;Art. 61.</p>

<p>If the commander of the belligerent warship has reason to suspect
that the confidence of the commander of the convoy has been abused,
he communicates his suspicions to him. In such a case it is for the
commander of the convoy alone to investigate the matter. He must
record the result of such investigation in a report, of which a copy is
handed to the officer of the warship. If, in the opinion of the commander
of the convoy, the facts shown in the report justify the capture
of one or more vessels, the protection of the convoy must be
withdrawn from such vessels.&mdash;Art. 62.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONWAY, HENRY SEYMOUR<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1721-1795), English field
marshal and statesman, was the second son of Francis Seymour,
of Ragley, Warwickshire, who took the name of Conway on
succeeding to the estates of the earl of Conway in 1699 and was
created Baron Conway in 1703 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seymour</a></span> or <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">St Maur</a></span>).
Henry Seymour Conway&rsquo;s elder brother, Francis, 2nd Baron
Conway, was created marquess of Hertford in 1793; his mother
was a sister of Sir Robert Walpole&rsquo;s wife, and he was therefore
first cousin to Horace Walpole, with whom he was on terms of intimate
friendship throughout his life. Having entered the army
at an early age, Conway was elected to the Irish parliament in
1741 as member for Antrim, which he continued to represent
for twenty years; in the same year he became a member of the
English House of Commons, sitting for Higham Ferrers in
Northamptonshire, and he remained in parliament, representing
successively a number of different constituencies, almost without
interruption for more than forty years. Meantime he saw much
service in the army abroad, where he served with conspicuous
bravery and not without distinction. In 1745 he became
aide-de-camp to the duke of Cumberland in Germany, and was
present at Fontenoy; in the following year he had command
of a regiment at Culloden. In 1755 he went to Ireland as secretary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
to the lord-lieutenant, a position which he held for one year only;
and on his return to England he received a court appointment,
having already been promoted major-general. In 1757 he was
associated with Sir John Mordaunt in command of an abortive
expedition against Rochfort, the complete failure of which
brought Conway into discredit and involved him in a pamphlet
controversy. In 1759 he became lieutenant-general, and served
under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in the campaigns of 1761-1763.
Returning to England he took part in the debates in
parliament on the Wilkes case, in which he opposed the views
of the court, speaking strongly against the legality of general
warrants. His conduct in this matter highly incensed the king,
who insisted on Conway being deprived of his military command
as well as of his appointment in the royal household. His
dismissal along with other officers was the occasion of another
paper controversy in which Conway was defended by Horace
Walpole, and gave rise to much constitutional dispute as to
the right of the king to remove military officers for their conduct
in parliament&mdash;a right that was tacitly abandoned by the Crown
when the Rockingham ministry of 1765 reinstated the officers
who had been removed.</p>

<p>In this ministry Conway took office as secretary of state, with
the leadership of the House of Commons. In the dispute with
the American colonies his sympathies were with the latter, and
in 1766 he carried the repeal of the Stamp Act. When in July
of that year Rockingham gave place to Chatham, Conway
retained his office; and when Chatham became incapacitated by
illness he tamely acquiesced in Townshend&rsquo;s reversal of the
American policy which he himself had so actively furthered in
the previous administration. In January 1768, offended by the
growing influence of the Bedford faction which joined the government,
Conway resigned the seals of office, though he was persuaded
by the king to remain a member of the cabinet and
&ldquo;Minister of the House of Commons.&rdquo; When, however, Lord
North became premier in 1770, Conway resigned from the
cabinet and was appointed to the command of the royal regiment
of horse guards; and in 1772 he became governor of Jersey,
the island being twice invaded by the French during his tenure
of command. In 1780 and 1781 he took an active part in opposition
to Lord North&rsquo;s American policy, and it was largely as the
result of his motion on the 22nd of February in the latter year,
demanding the cessation of the war against the colonies, when
the ministerial majority was reduced to one, that Lord North
resigned office. In the Rockingham government that followed
General Conway became commander-in-chief with a seat in the
cabinet; and he retained office under Shelburne when Rockingham
died a few months later. On Pitt&rsquo;s elevation to the premiership,
Conway supported Fox in opposition; but after the
dissolution of parliament in 1784 he retired from political life.
He was made field marshal in 1793, and died at Henley-on-Thames
on the 9th of July 1795. Conway married in 1747 Caroline,
daughter of General Campbell (afterwards duke of Argyll), and
widow of the earl of Aylesbury. He had one daughter, Anne,
who married John Darner, son of Lord Milton, and who inherited
a life interest in Strawberry Hill under the will of Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>Conway was personally one of the most popular men of his
day. He was handsome, conciliatory and agreeable, and a
man of refined taste and untarnished honour. As a soldier he
was a dashing officer, but a poor general. He was weak, vacillating
and ineffective as a politician, lacking in judgment and
decision, and without any great parliamentary talent. In his
later years he dabbled in literature and the drama, and interested
himself in arboriculture in his retirement at Henley-on-Thames.</p>

Bristol on the 26th of December 1847, the son of an auctioneer.
He was intended for his father&rsquo;s business, but at the age of
thirteen joined the training-ship &ldquo;Conway&rdquo; in the Mersey.
In deference to his father&rsquo;s wishes, however, he gave up the idea
of becoming a sailor, and returned to Bristol, where he was
articled to a firm of accountants till on his father&rsquo;s death in
1868 he took over the family business. While a clerk he had
written the words for various songs, adopting the nom-de-plume
Hugh Conway in memory of his days on the training-ship. Mr
Arrowsmith, the Bristol printer and publisher, took an interest
in his work, and Fargus&rsquo;s first short story appeared in <i>Arrowsmith&rsquo;s
Miscellany</i>. In 1883 Fargus published through Arrowsmith
his first long story, <i>Called Back</i>, of which over 350,000
copies were sold within four years. A dramatic version of this
book was produced in London in 1884, and in this year Fargus
published another story, <i>Dark Days</i>. Ordered to the Riviera

<p><span class="bold">CONWAY, MONCURE DANIEL<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1832-1907), American
clergyman and author, was born of an old Virginia family in
Stafford county, Virginia, on the 17th of March 1832. He
graduated at Dickinson College in 1849, studied law for a year,
and then became a Methodist minister in his native state. In
1852, owing largely to the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson,
his religious and political views underwent a radical change, and
he entered the Harvard Divinity School, where he graduated
in 1854. Here he fell under the influence of &ldquo;transcendentalism,&rdquo;
and became an outspoken abolitionist. On his return to
Virginia this fact and his rumoured connexion with the attempt
to rescue the fugitive slave, Anthony Burns, in Boston aroused
the bitter hostility of his old neighbours and friends, and in
consequence he left the state. In 1854-1856 he was pastor of
a Unitarian church at Washington, D.C., but his anti-slavery
views brought about his dismissal. From 1856 to 1861 he was a
Unitarian minister in Cincinnati, Ohio, where, also, he edited
a short-lived liberal periodical called <i>The Dial</i>. Subsequently
he was an editor of the <i>Commonwealth</i> in Boston, Mass., and
wrote <i>The Rejected Stone</i> (1861) and <i>The Golden Hour</i> (1862),
both powerful pleas for emancipation. In 1862-1863, during
the Civil War, he lectured in England in behalf of the North.
From 1863 to 1884 he was the minister of the South Place chapel,
Finsbury, London; and during this time wrote frequently for
the London press. In 1884 he returned to the United States
to devote himself to literary work. In addition to those above
mentioned, his publications include <i>Tracts for To-day</i> (1858),
<i>The Natural History of the Devil</i> (1859), <i>Testimonies Concerning
Slavery</i> (1864), <i>The Earthward Pilgrimage</i> (1870), <i>Republican

critic and mountaineer, son of the Rev. William Conway, afterwards
canon of Westminster, was born at Rochester, and was
educated at Repton and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He
became interested in early printing and engraving, and in 1880
made a tour of the principal libraries of Europe in pursuit of his
studies, the result appearing in 1884 as a <i>History of the Woodcutters
of the Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century</i>. His later works
on art included <i>Early Flemish Artists</i> (1887); <i>The Literary
Remains of Albrecht Dürer</i> (1889); <i>The Dawn of Art in the
Ancient World</i> (1891), dealing with Chaldaean, Assyrian and
Egyptian art; <i>Early Tuscan Artists</i> (1902). From 1884 to 1887
he was professor of art at University College, Liverpool; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
1901-1904 he was Slade professor of the fine arts at Cambridge.
He was knighted in 1895. Sir Martin Conway early became a
member of the Alpine Club, of which he was president from 1902
to 1904. In 1892 he beat the climbing record by ascending to a
height of 23,000 ft. in the Himalayas in the course of an exploring
and mountaineering expedition undertaken under the auspices
of the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical Society and the
British Association. In 1896-1897 he explored the interior of
Spitsbergen, and in the next year he explored and surveyed the
Bolivian Andes, climbing Sorata (21,500 ft.) and Illimani
(21,200 ft.). He also ascended Aconcagua (23,080 ft.) and
explored Tierra del Fuego. At the Paris exhibition of 1900 he
received the gold medal for mountain surveys, and the founder&rsquo;s
medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1905. His expeditions

<p><span class="bold">CONWAY<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (<i>Conwy</i>, or <i>Aberconwy</i>), a municipal borough in the
Arfon parliamentary division of Carnarvonshire, N. Wales, 14 m.
by the London &amp; North-Western railway from Bangor, and 225
m. N.W. from London. Pop. (1901) 4681. The town is enclosed
by a high wall, roughly triangular, about 1 m. round, with
twenty-one dilapidated round towers, pierced by three principal
gateways with two strong towers. The castle in the south-east
angle, built in 1284 by Edward I., was inhabited, in 1389, by
Richard II., who here agreed to abdicate. Held for Charles I. by
Archbishop Williams, it was taken by General Mytton in 1646.
Dismantled by the new proprietor, Earl Conway, it remains a
ruin. It is oblong, with eight massive towers, and has, within, a
hall 130 ft. in length, known as Llewelyn&rsquo;s. The parliamentary
borough of Conway, returning, with five other towns, one member,
extends over to the right bank of the stream Conwy (Conway).
In 1885 the mayor of Conway was made a constable. Llandudno
with Great and Little Orme&rsquo;s Heads are at some 4 m. distance.
Two bridges, a tubular for the railway (40 ft. shorter than that of
the Menai) and a suspension, designed by Stephenson (1846-1848)
and Telford (1822-1826) respectively, cross the stream.
St Mary&rsquo;s church is Gothic; the Elizabethan Plâs Mawr is the
<i>locale</i> of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art. There are still
some fragments of the 1185 Cistercian Abbey. There are golf
links here and at Llandudno. The Conwy stream, on which a
steamboat runs from Deganwy (2 m. below Conway town) to
Trefriw, opposite Llanrwst, in summer, has some coasting trade
in sulphur and slates. It is about 30 m. long, its valley (a
haunt of artists) containing the towns last mentioned and
Bettws y coed. Its pearls are mentioned in Drayton&rsquo;s <i>Polyolbion</i>
and Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queene</i>. Pearl fisheries existed at Conway
for many centuries, dating back to the Roman occupation.
Tacitus, <i>Agricola</i>, 12, says of Britain &ldquo;gignit et Oceanus
margarita, sed subfusca ac liventia,&rdquo; as are those found to-day.
Diganhwy (Dyganwy, Deganwy) is mentioned in the <i>Mabinogion</i>
(<i>Geraint and Enid</i>), if the reading is sound; it is certainly
mentioned in the <i>Annales Cambriae</i> (years 812-822) and in the
<i>Black Book of Caerfyrddin</i> (Carmarthen), xxiii. 1. Caer-hyn, 4½
m. from Conway, is on the highroad from London to Holyhead,
and is the <i>Conovium</i> of the Romans. The site of the camp can
still be traced, consisting of a square, strengthened by four
parallel walls, extending to a distance from the main work.
The camp is on a height, with the Conwy in front and a wood on
each flank. At the foot of the hill, near the stream, was a Roman
bath, with walls, pavement and pillars. Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i>
mentions tiles, with marks of the 10th or Antoninus&rsquo;s legion,
as being found here, perhaps mistakenly. <i>Gleini nadroedd</i>
(possibly amulets) and <i>vitrum</i> have been found here. In Bwlch y
ddwy faen (&ldquo;two rock ravine&rdquo;), on the way to Aber, are the
remains of a Roman road and antiquities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONYBEARE, WILLIAM DANIEL<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1787-1857), dean of
Llandaff, one of the most distinguished of English geologists, who
was born in London on the 7th of June 1787, was a grandson of
John Conybeare, bishop of Bristol (1692-1755), a notable preacher
and divine, and son of Dr William Conybeare, rector of Bishopsgate.
Educated first at Westminster school, he went in 1805 to
Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1808 he took his degree of B.A.,
with a first in classics and second in mathematics, and proceeded
to M.A. three years later. Having entered holy orders he
became in 1814 curate of Wardington, near Banbury, and he
accepted also a lectureship at Brislington near Bristol. During
this period he was one of the founders of the Bristol Philosophical
Institution (1822). He was rector of Sully in Glamorganshire
from 1823 to 1836, and vicar of Axminster from 1836 to 1844.
He was appointed Bampton lecturer in 1839, and was instituted
to the deanery of Llandaff in 1845. Attracted to the study of
geology by the lectures of Dr John Kidd (<i>q.v.</i>) he pursued the
subject with ardour. As soon as he had left college he made
extended journeys in Britain and on the continent, and he
became one of the early members of the Geological Society.
Both Buckland and Sedgwick acknowledged their indebtedness
to him for instruction received when they first began to devote
attention to geology. To the <i>Transactions of the Geological
Society</i> as well as to the <i>Annals of Philosophy</i> and <i>Philosophical
Magazine</i> he contributed many geological memoirs. In 1821 he
distinguished himself by the description of a skeleton of the
<i>Plesiosaurus</i>, discovered by Mary Anning, and his account has
been confirmed in all main points by subsequent researches.
Among his most important memoirs is that on the south-western
coal district of England, written in conjunction with Dr Buckland,
and published in 1824. He wrote also on the valley of the Thames,
on Elie de Beaumont&rsquo;s theory of mountain-chains, and on the
great landslip which occurred near Lyme Regis in 1839 when
he was vicar of Axminster. His principal work, however, is the
<i>Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales</i> (1822), being a second
edition of the small work issued by William Phillips (<i>q.v.</i>) and
written in co-operation with that author. The original contributions
of Conybeare formed the principal portion of this edition,
of which only Part I., dealing with the Carboniferous and newer
strata, was published. It affords evidence throughout of the
extensive and accurate knowledge possessed by Conybeare;
and it exercised a marked influence on the progress of geology
in this country. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and a
corresponding member of the Institute of France. In 1844 he
was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of

his mind and hastened his end. He died at Itchenstoke, near
Portsmouth, a few months after his son, on the 12th of August
1857. (Obituary in <i>Gent. Mag.</i> Sept. 1857, p. 335.)</p>

<p>His elder brother <span class="sc">John Josias Conybeare</span> (1779-1824), also
educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and an accomplished scholar,
became vicar of Batheaston, and was professor of Anglo-Saxon
and afterwards of poetry at Oxford. He likewise was an ardent
student of geology and communicated several important papers

of a solicitor. After considerable experience as an engineer in
the west of England he came to London, and from 1844-1847
had a consulting practice in Westminster. In the latter year
he was appointed resident engineer in charge of the extensive
national harbour works at Portland then in progress. In 1856
he was appointed engineer-in-chief of this undertaking, and this
post he retained till the completion of the works in 1872. His

especially by those of South Africa and Australia, and by the
Indian government. After the Portland harbour his best-known
work is the harbour of Colombo, Ceylon. He was made a

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COOK, JAMES<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (1728-1779), English naval captain and
explorer, was born on the 28th of October 1728, at Marton
village, Cleveland, Yorkshire, where his father was first an
agricultural labourer and then a farm bailiff. At twelve years
of age he was apprenticed to a haberdasher at Staithes, near
Whitby, and afterwards to Messrs Walker, shipowners, of
Whitby, whom he served for years in the Norway, Baltic and
Newcastle trades.</p>

<p>In 1755, having risen to be a mate, Cook joined the royal
navy, and after four years&rsquo; service was, on the recommendation
of Sir Hugh Palliser, his commander, appointed master successively
of the sloop &ldquo;Grampus,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Garland&rdquo; and of the
&ldquo;Solebay,&rdquo; in the last of which he served in the St Lawrence.
He was employed also in sounding and surveying the river, and
he published a chart of the channel from Quebec to the sea. In
1762 he was present at the recapture of Newfoundland, and was
employed in surveying portions of this coast (especially Placentia
Harbour); in 1763, on Palliser becoming governor of Newfoundland,
Cook was appointed &ldquo;marine surveyor of the coast of
Newfoundland and Labrador&rdquo;; this office he held till 1767;
and the volumes of sailing directions he now brought out (1766-1768)
showed remarkable abilities. At the same time he began
to make his reputation as a mathematician and astronomer by
his observation of the solar eclipse of the 5th of August 1766,
at one of the Burgeo Islands, near Cape Ray, and by his account
of the same in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> (vol. lvii. pp.
215-216).</p>

<p>In 1768 Cook was appointed to conduct an expedition,
suggested by the revival of geographical interest now noticeable,
and resolved on by the English admiralty at the instance of the
Royal Society, for observing the impending transit of Venus, and
prosecuting geographical researches in the South Pacific Ocean.
For these purposes he received a commission as lieutenant (May
25th), and set sail in the &ldquo;Endeavour,&rdquo; of 370 tons, accompanied
by several men of science, including Sir Joseph Banks (August
25th). On the 13th of April 1769, he reached Tahiti, where he
observed the transit on the 3rd of June. From Tahiti he sailed in
quest of the great continent then supposed to exist in the South
Pacific, explored the Society Islands, and thence struck to New
Zealand, whose coasts he circumnavigated and examined with
great care for six months, charting them for the first time with
fair accuracy, and especially observing the channel (&ldquo;Cook
Strait&rdquo;) which divided the North and South Islands. His
attempts to penetrate to the interior, however, were thwarted by
native hostility. From New Zealand he proceeded to &ldquo;New
Holland&rdquo; or Australia, and surveyed with the same minuteness
and accuracy the whole east coast. New South Wales he named
after a supposed resemblance to Glamorganshire; Botany Bay,
sighted on the 28th of April 1770, was so called by the
naturalists of the expedition. On account of the hostility of the
natives his discoveries here also were confined to the coast, of
which he took possession for Great Britain. From Australia
Cook sailed to Batavia, satisfying himself upon the way that (as
Torres had first shown in 1607) New Guinea was in no way an
outlying part of the greater land mass to the south.</p>

<p>Arriving in England, by way of the Cape of Good Hope, on the
12th of June, Cook was made a commander, and soon after was
appointed to command another expedition for examining and
determining once for all the question of the supposed great
southern continent. With the &ldquo;Resolution&rdquo; of 462 tons, the
&ldquo;Adventure&rdquo; (Captain Furneaux) of 330 tons, and 193 men,
he sailed from Plymouth on the 13th of July 1772; he touched at
the Cape of Good Hope, and striking thence south-east (November
22nd) passed the Antarctic Circle (January 16th, 1773), repassed
the same, and made his way to New Zealand (March 26th)
without discovering land. From New Zealand he resumed his
&ldquo;search for a continent,&rdquo; working up and down across the South
Pacific, and penetrating to 67° 31&prime; and again to 71° 10&prime; S., with
imminent risk of destruction from floating ice, but with the
satisfaction of disproving the possibility of the disputed continent
in the seas south-eastward of New Zealand. He then
made for Easter Island, whose exact position he determined, for
the first time, with accuracy; noticing and describing the gigantic
statues which Roggewein, the first discoverer of the island, had
made known. In the same manner he accomplished a better
determination and examination of the Marquesas, as well as of
the Tonga or Friendly Islands, than had yet been made; and
after a stay at Tahiti to rest and refit, crossed the central Pacific
to the &ldquo;New Hebrides,&rdquo; as he renamed Quiros&rsquo;s &ldquo;Southern
Land of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (a name preserved in the modern
island of <i>Espiritu Santo</i>), called by Bougainville the &ldquo;Great
Cyclades&rdquo; (<i>Grandes Cyclades</i>), whose position, extent, divisions
and character were now verified as never before. Next followed
the wholly new discoveries of New Caledonia, Norfolk Island,
and the Isle of Pines. Another visit to New Zealand, and yet
another examination of the far southern Pacific, which was
crossed from west to east through the whole of its extent, from
south Australia to Tierra del Fuego, were now undertaken by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
Cook before he finally closed his work in refutation of the Antarctic
continent, as previously understood, on this side of the
world. The voyage closed with a rapid survey of the &ldquo;Land of
Fire,&rdquo; the rounding of Cape Horn, the rediscovery of the island
now named Southern Georgia, the discovery of Sandwich Land,
the crossing of the South Atlantic (here also exploding the great
<i>Terra Australis</i> delusion), and visits to the Cape of Good Hope,
St Helena, Ascension, Fernando Noronha and the Azores.
The voyage (reckoning only from the Cape of Good Hope and
back to the same) had covered considerably more than 20,000
leagues, nearly three times the equatorial circumference of the
earth; it left the main outlines of the southern portions of the
globe substantially as they are known to-day; and it showed a
possibility of keeping a number of men for years at sea without a
heavy toll of lives. Cook only lost one man out of 118 in more
than 1000 days; he had conquered scurvy.</p>

<p>The discoverer reached Plymouth on the 25th of July 1775,
and his achievements were promptly, if meanly, rewarded. He
was immediately raised to the rank of post-captain, appointed a
captain in Greenwich hospital, and soon afterwards unanimously
elected a member of the Royal Society, from which he received
the Copley gold medal for the best experimental paper which had
appeared during the year.</p>

<p>Cook&rsquo;s third and last voyage was primarily to settle the
question of the north-west passage, practically abandoned since
before the middle of the 17th century, but now taken up again, as
a matter of scientific interest, by the British government. The
explorer, who had volunteered for this service, was instructed to
sail first into the Pacific through the chain of the newly discovered
islands which he had recently visited, and on reaching
New Albion to proceed northward as far as latitude 65° and
endeavour to find a passage to the Atlantic. Several ships were
at the same time fitted out to attempt a passage on the other side
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Sailing from the Nore on the
25th of June 1776 (Plymouth, July 12), with the &ldquo;Resolution&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; and touching at the Cape of Good Hope,
which he left on the 30th of November, Cook next made Tasmania
and thence passed on to New Zealand and the Tonga and Society
Islands, discovering on his way several of the larger members of
the Hervey or Cook Archipelago, especially Mangaia and Aitutaki
(March 30th-April 4th, 1777); some smaller isles of this group he
had already sighted on his second voyage, September 23rd,
1773. From Tahiti, as he moved north towards the main object
of his expedition, he made a far more important discovery, or
rather rediscovery, that of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands,
the greatest and most remarkable of the Polynesian archipelagos
(early February 1778). These had perhaps first been seen by the
Spanish navigator Gaetano in 1555; but their existence had been
kept a close secret by Spain at the time, and had long been
forgotten. Striking the west American coast in 44° 55&prime; N. on the
7th of March following, he made an almost continuous survey of
the same up to Bering Straits and beyond, as far as 70° 41&prime;,
where he found the passage barred by a wall, or rather continent,
of ice, rising 12 ft. above water, and stretching as far as the eye
could reach. The farthest point visible on the American shore
(in the extreme north-west of Alaska) he called Icy Cape. On
his way towards Bering Straits he discovered and named King
George&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Nootka&rdquo;) and Prince William&rsquo;s Sound, as well as
Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost extremity of North
America, never yet seen by English navigators, but well known
to Russian explorers, who probably first sighted it in 1648; he
also penetrated into the bay afterwards known as Cook&rsquo;s Inlet
or River, which at first seemed to promise a passage to the
Arctic Seas, to the south-east of the Alaska peninsula. Cook
next visited the Asiatic shores of Bering Straits (the extreme
north-east of Siberia); returning to America, he explored
Norton Sound, north of the Yukon; touched at (Aleutian)
Unalaska, where he met with some Russian-American settlers;
and thence made his way back to the Hawaiian group, which he
had christened after his friend and patron Lord Sandwich, then
head of the British admiralty (January 17th, 1779). Here he
visited Maui and Hawaii itself, whose size and importance he now
first realized, and in one of whose bays (Kealakekua) he met his
death early in the morning of the 14th of February 1779. During
the night of the 13th, one of the &ldquo;Discovery&rsquo;s&rdquo; boats was stolen
by the natives; and Cook, in order to recover it, made trial of
his favourite expedient of seizing the king&rsquo;s person until reparation
should be made. Having landed on the following day with
some marines, a scuffle ensued which compelled the party to
retreat to their boats. Cook was the last to retire; and as he was
nearing the shore he received a blow from behind which felled him
to the ground. He rose immediately, and vigorously resisted the
crowds that pressed upon him, but was soon overpowered.</p>

<p>Had Cook returned from his third voyage, there is ground for
believing King George would have made him a baronet. Distinguished
honours were paid to his memory, both at home and
by foreign courts, and a pension was settled upon his widow.
But in his life a very inadequate share of official reward was
dealt out to the man who not only may be placed first among
British maritime discoverers, but also gave his country her title,
and so her colonies, in Australasia. As a commander, an observer
and a practical physician, his merits were equally great. Reference
has been made to his survey work and to his victory over
scurvy; it must not be forgotten that along with a commanding
personal presence, and with sagacity, decision and perseverance
quite extraordinary, went other qualities not less useful to his
work. He won the affection of those who served under him by
sympathy, kindness and unselfish care of others as noteworthy
as his gifts of intellect.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOK, THOMAS<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1808-1892), English travelling agent, was
born at Melbourne in Derbyshire on the 22nd of November 1808.
Beginning work at the age of ten, he was successively a gardener&rsquo;s
help and a wood-turner at Melbourne, and a printer at Loughborough.
At the age of twenty he became a Bible-reader and
village missionary for the county of Rutland; but in 1832, on
his marriage, combined his wood-turning business with that
occupation. In 1836 he became a total abstainer, and subsequently
became actively associated with the temperance
movement, and printed at his own expense various publications
in its interest, notably the <i>Children&rsquo;s Temperance Magazine</i>
(1840), the first of its kind to appear in England. In June 1841
a large meeting was to be held at Loughborough in connexion
with this movement, and Cook was struck with the idea of getting
the Midland Counties Railway Company to run a special train from
Leicester to the meeting. The company consented, and on the 5th
of July there were carried 570 passengers from Leicester to Loughborough
and back at a shilling a head. This is believed to be the
first publicly-advertised excursion train ever run in England&mdash;private
&ldquo;specials,&rdquo; reserved for members of institutes and similar
bodies, were already in use. The event caused great excitement,
and Cook received so many applications to organize similar
parties that he henceforward deserted wood-turning, while
continuing his printing and publishing. The summers of the
next three years were occupied with excursions like the first;
but in 1845 Cook advertised a pleasure-trip on a more extensive
scale, from Leicester to Liverpool and back, with opportunities
for visiting the Isle of Man, Dublin and Welsh coast. A <i>Handbook
of the Trip to Liverpool</i> was supplied for the use of travellers.
In the previous year Cook had entered into a permanent arrangement
with the Midland Railway Company to place trains at
his disposal, for which he should provide the passengers. A
trip to Scotland followed, and the excursionists were received
in Glasgow with music and salute of guns.</p>

<p>The next great impetus to popular travel was given by the
Great Exhibition of 1851, which Cook helped 165,000 visitors
to attend. On the occasion of the Paris exhibition of 1855 there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
was a Cook&rsquo;s excursion from Leicester to Calais and back for
£1:10s. The following year saw the first grand circular tour
in Europe. This part of Cook&rsquo;s activity largely increased after
1863, when the Scottish railway managers broke off their
engagements with him, and left him free for more distant
enterprise. Switzerland was opened up in 1863, and Italy in
1864. Up to this time &ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s tourists&rdquo; had been personally
conducted, but now he began to be an agent for the sale of
English and foreign tickets, the holders of which travelled independently.
Switzerland was the first foreign country accessible
under these conditions, and in 1865 nearly the whole of Europe
was included in the scheme. Its extension to the United States
followed in 1866. For the benefit of visitors to the Paris exhibition,
Cook made a fresh departure and leased a hotel there.
In the same year began his system of &ldquo;hotel-coupons,&rdquo; providing
accommodation at a fixed charge. The year 1869 was marked
by an extension of Cook&rsquo;s tours to Palestine, followed by further
developments of travel in the East, his son, John Mason Cook,
(1834-1899), being appointed in 1870 agent of the khedivial
government for passenger traffic on the Nile. The Franco-German
War of 1870-1871 was expected to damage the tourist
system, but, as a matter of fact, encouraged it, through the demand
for combination, international tickets enabling travellers
to reach the south of Europe without crossing the belligerent
countries. At the termination of the war a party of American
freemasons visited Paris under J. M. Cook&rsquo;s guidance, and became
the precursors of the present vast American tourist traffic. At
the beginning of 1872 J. M. Cook entered into formal partnership
with his father, and the firm first took the name of Thomas
Cook &amp; Son. In 1882, on the outbreak of Arabi Pasha&rsquo;s rebellion,
Thomas Cook &amp; Son were commissioned to convey Sir Garnet
Wolseley and his suite to Egypt, and to transport the wounded
and sick up the Nile by water, for which they received the thanks
of the war office. The firm was again employed in 1884 to convey
General Gordon to the Sudan, and the whole of the men (18,000)
and stores necessary for the expedition afterwards sent to relieve
him. In 1889 Thomas Cook &amp; Son acquired the exclusive right
of carrying the mails, specie, soldiers and officials of the Egyptian
government along the Nile. In 1891 the firm celebrated its
jubilee, and on the 19th of July of the following year Thomas
Cook died. He had been afflicted with blindness in his declining
years. His son, J. M. Cook, died in 1899, leaving three sons, all
actively engaged in the business.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOK<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Hervey</span> <span class="bold">ISLANDS,</span> an archipelago in the Pacific
Ocean, lying mainly between 155° and 160° E., and about 20° S.;
a dependency of the British colony of New Zealand. It comprises
nine partly volcanic, partly coralline, islands, the more
important of which are Rarotonga, hilly, fertile and well watered,
with several cones 300 to 400 ft. high, above which towers the
majestic Rarotonga volcano (2920 ft.), the culminating point
of the archipelago; Mangaia (Mangia); Aitutaki, with luxuriant
cocoa-nut palm groves; Atui (Vatui); Mitiero; Mauki;
Fenuaiti; and the two Hervey Islets, which give an alternative
name to the group. The total land area is 111 sq. m. Owing
to its healthy, equable climate, the archipelago is well suited
for European settlement; but the dangerous fringing coral
reefs render it difficult of access, and it suffers also from the
absence of good harbours. The natives, who are of Polynesian
stock and speech, have legends of their emigration from Samoa.
They say their ancestors found black people on the islands, and
the strongly Melanesian type which is found, especially on
Mangaia, supports the statement. The Cook Islanders were
formerly man-hunters and cannibals, but they now are nearly
all Protestants, wear European dress and live in stone houses.
The total population is about 6200. Since 1890 the islands have
enjoyed a general legislature and an executive council of which
the <i>Arikis</i> (&ldquo;kings&rdquo; and &ldquo;queens&rdquo;) are members. But all
enactments are subject to the approval of the British resident
at Rarotonga, and a British protectorate, proclaimed in 1888,
was followed by the annexation of the whole archipelago by the
governor of New Zealand, by proclamation of June 10th, 1901.
The archipelago was discovered by Captain Cook in 1777, and
in 1823 became the scene of the remarkable missionary labours
of John Williams, of the London Missionary Society. The
chief products of the group are cocoanuts, fruits, coffee and
copra. Lime-juice and hats are made.</p>

His first London appearance was at the Haymarket in 1778, but
it was not until 1794 in Dublin, as Othello, that he attained
high rank in his profession. In 1801 he appeared in London as
Richard III., Iago, Shylock and Sir Giles Overreach, and became
the rival of Kemble, with whom, however, and with Mrs Siddons,
he acted from 1803. His intemperate habits unfortunately grew
more and more notorious, and on at least one occasion the curtain
had to be rung down owing to the audience hissing his drunken
condition. He visited the United States in 1810, and died in
New York on the 26th of September 1811. A monument to his

member of Congress from that state in 1831-1833. Being
destined for a commercial career, Jay Cooke received a preliminary
training in a trading house in St Louis, and in the
booking office of a transportation company in Philadelphia, and
at the age of eighteen entered the Philadelphia house of E.W.
Clark &amp; Company, one of the largest private banking firms in
the country. He showed such aptitude for business that three
years later he was admitted to membership in the firm, and
before he was thirty he was also a partner in the New York and
St Louis branches of the Clarks. In 1858 he retired from the
firm, and for the next three years he devoted himself to reorganizing
some of the abandoned Pennsylvania railways and canals and
placing them again in operation. On the 1st of January 1861 he
opened in Philadelphia the private banking house of Jay Cooke
&amp; Company, and soon achieved signal success in floating at par
a war loan of $3,000,000 for the state of Pennsylvania, whose
credit had become notoriously bad. In the early months of the
Civil War Cooke co-operated with the secretary of the treasury,
Salmon P. Chase, in securing loans from the leading bankers in
the Northern cities, and his own firm was so successful in distributing
treasury notes that Chase engaged him as special agent
for the sale of the $500,000,000 of so-called &ldquo;five-twenty&rdquo;
bonds authorized by the act of the 25th of February 1862. To
dispose of these bonds the treasury department had already tried
every regular means at its command and had failed. Cooke
secured the influence of the American press, appointed 2500
sub-agents, and before the machinery he set in motion could be
stopped he had sold $11,000,000 more of bonds than had been
authorized, an excess which Congress immediately sanctioned.
At the same time he used all his influence in favour of the establishment
of national banks, and organized a national bank at
Washington and another at Philadelphia almost as soon as such
institutions were authorized by Congress. In the early months of
1865, when the needs of the government were pressing, and the
sale of the new &ldquo;seven-thirty&rdquo; notes by the national banks had
been very disappointing, Cooke&rsquo;s services were again secured.
He sent agents into the remotest villages and hamlets, and even
into the isolated mining camps of the West, and caused the rural
newspapers to praise the loan. As a result, between February and
July 1865 he had disposed of three series of the notes, reaching a
total of $830,000,000. Through these efforts the Union soldiers
were well supplied and well paid while dealing the final blows of
the war; and, later, with money in their pockets, they were
disbanded without difficulty.</p>

<p>After the war Cooke became interested in the development of
the North-west, and in 1870 his firm undertook to finance the
construction of the Northern Pacific railway. In advancing the
money for the work, the firm over-estimated the possibilities of
its capital, and at the approach of the financial crisis of 1873 it
was forced to suspend. By 1880 Cooke had discharged all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
obligations, and through an investment in a silver mine in Utah
had again become wealthy. He died at Ogontz, Pennsylvania,
on the 18th of February 1905. Cooke was noted for his piety,
and gave regularly a tenth of his income for religious and charitable
purposes. His handsome estate at Ogontz, which he had
been compelled to give up during his bankruptcy, he later
repurchased and converted into a school for girls.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COOKERY<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (Lat. <i>coquus</i>, a cook), the art of preparing and
dressing food of all sorts for human consumption, of converting
the raw materials, by the application of heat or otherwise, into
a digestible and pleasing condition, and generally ministering to
the satisfaction of the appetite and the delight of the palate.
We may take it that some form of cookery has existed from the
earliest times, and its progress has been from the simple to the
elaborate, dominated partly by the foods accessible to man, partly
by the stage of civilization he has attained, and partly by the
appliances at his command for the purpose either of treating the
food, or of consuming it when served.</p>

<p>The developed art of cookery is necessarily a late addition&mdash;if
it may be considered to be included at all&mdash;to the list of &ldquo;fine
arts.&rdquo; Originally it is a purely industrial and useful art. Man,
says a French writer, was born a roaster, and &ldquo;<i>pour être cuisinier,
il a besoin de le devenir.</i>&rdquo; The ancients were great eaters, but
strangers to the subtler refinements of the palate. The gods
were supposed to love the smell of fried meat, while their nectar
and ambrosia represented an ideal, which, though preserved as a
phrase, would hardly satisfy a modern epicure. The ancients
were poorly provided with pots and pans, except of a simple
order, or with the appurtenances of a kitchen, and they were
sadly to seek in the requisites of a modern table. So long as
men ate with their hands no dainty confection was suitable; the
viands were set forth in a straightforward style fit for their
requirements. &ldquo;Plain cooking,&rdquo; which, after all, can never
become obsolete, was the only sort. Oddities, no doubt, were
the luxuries; and we can see to-day in the ethnological accounts
of contemporary savages and backward civilizations, a fair
representation of the cookeries of the ancients. The luxuries
of the Chinese are, in their way, a survival of long ages of a
cookery which to western civilization is grotesque. Even if it is
an historic impertinence, it is impossible for the countries of
western civilization to regard the fine flower of their own evolution
as other than the highest pitch of progress. <i>Autres temps,
autres m&oelig;urs.</i> To the Chinaman French cooking may possibly
be as grotesque as to an Englishman the Chinaman&rsquo;s hundred-year-old
buried egg, black and tasteless. The history of comparative
cookery is bound up with the physical possibilities of
each country and its products; and if we attempt to mark out
stages in the evolution of cookery as a fine art, it is necessarily as
understood by the so-called civilized peoples of the West in their
culmination at the present day.</p>

<p>It is obvious that opportunity has dominated its history, for
the art of cookery is to some extent the product of an increased
refinement of taste, consequent on culture and increase of wealth.
To this extent it is a decadent art, ministering to the luxury
of man, and to his progressive inclination to be pampered and
have his appetite tickled. It is thus only remotely connected
with the mere necessities of nutrition (<i>q.v.</i>), or the science of
dietetics (<i>q.v.</i>). Mere hunger, though the best sauce, will not
produce cookery, which is the art of sauces. For centuries its
elaboration consisted mainly of a progressive variety of foods,
the richest and rarest being sought out; and their nature
depended on what was most difficult to obtain. The Greeks
learnt by contact with Asia to increase the sumptuous character
of their banquets, but we know little enough of their ideas of
gastronomy. Athens was the centre of luxury. According to
our chief authority Athenaeus, Archestratus of Gela, the friend
of the son of Pericles, the guide of Epicurus, and author of the
<i>Heduphagetica</i>, was a great traveller, and took pains to get
information as to how the delicacies of the table were prepared
in different parts. His lost work was versified by Ennius. Other
connoisseurs seem to have been Numenius of Heraclea, Hegemon
of Thasos, Philogenes of Leucas, Simonaclides of Chios, and
Tyndarides of Sicyon. The Romans, emerging from their
pristine simplicity, borrowed from the Greeks their achievements
in gastronomic pleasure. We read of this or that Roman gourmet,
such as Lucullus, his extravagances and his luxury. The name
of the connoisseur Apicius, after whom a work of the time of
Heliogabalus is called, comes down to us in association with a
manual of cookery. And from Macrobius and Petronius we can
gather very interesting glimpses of the Roman idea of a menu.
In the later empire, tradition still centred round the Roman
cookery favoured by the geographical position of Italy; while
the customs and natural products of the remoter parts of Europe
gradually begin to assert themselves as the middle ages progress.</p>

<p>It is, however, not till the Renaissance, and then too with
Italy as the starting-point, that the history of modern cookery
really begins. Meanwhile cookery may be studied rather in
the architecture of kitchens, and the development of their
appurtenances and personnel, than in any increase in the
subtleties of the art; the ideal was inevitably gross; the end
was feeding&mdash;inextricably associated in all ages with cooking,
but as distinct from its <i>fine fleur</i> as gluttony from gastronomy.</p>

<p>Montaigne&rsquo;s references to the revival of cookery in France
by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici indicate that the new attention paid
to the art was really novel. She brought Italian cooks to Paris
and introduced there a cultured simplicity which was unknown
in France before. It is to the Italians apparently that later
developments are originally due. It is clearly established, for
instance (says Abraham Hayward in his <i>Art of Dining</i>), that the
Italians introduced ices into France. Fricandeaus were invented
by the <i>chef</i> of Leo X. And Coryate in his <i>Crudities</i>, writing in
the time of James I., says that he was called &ldquo;furcifer&rdquo; (evidently
in contemptuous jest) by his friends, from his using those
&ldquo;Italian neatnesses called forks.&rdquo; The use of the fork and
spoon marked an epoch in the progress of dining, and consequently
of cookery.</p>

<p>Under Louis XIV. further advances were made. His <i>maître
d&rsquo;hôtel</i>, Béchamel, is famous for his sauce; and Vatel, the great
Condé&rsquo;s cook, was a celebrated artist, of whose suicide in despair
at the tardy arrival of the fish which he had ordered, Madame
de Sévigné relates a moving story. The prince de Soubise,
immortalized by his onion sauce, also had a famous chef.</p>

<p>In England the names of certain cookery-books may be noted,
such as Sir J. Elliott&rsquo;s (1539), Abraham Veale&rsquo;s (1575), and the
<i>Widdowe&rsquo;s Treasure</i> (1625). The <i>Accomplisht Cook</i>, by Robert
May, appeared in 1665, and from its preface we learn that the
author (who speaks disparagingly of French cookery, but more
gratefully of Italian and Spanish) was the son of a cook, and had
studied abroad and under his father (c. 1610) at Lady Dormer&rsquo;s,
and he speaks of that time as &ldquo;the days wherein were produced
the triumphs and trophies of cookery.&rdquo; From his description
they consisted of most fantastic and elaborately built up dishes,
intended to amuse and startle, no less than to satisfy the appetite
and palate.</p>

<p>Louis XV. was a great gourmet; and his reign saw many
developments in the culinary art. The mayonnaise (originally
<i>mahonnaise</i>) is ascribed to the duc de Richelieu. Such dishes
as &ldquo;<i>potage à la Xavier</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>cailles à la Mirepoix</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>chartreuses
à la Mauconseil</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>poulets à la Villeroy</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>potage à la Condé</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>gigot à la Mailly</i>,&rdquo; owe their titles to celebrities of the day,
and the Pompadour gave her name to various others. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
Jesuits Brunoy and Bougeant, who wrote a preface to a contemporary
treatise on cookery (1739), described the modern
art as &ldquo;more simple, more appropriate, and more cunning,
than that of old days,&rdquo; giving the ingredients the same union
as painters give to colours, and harmonizing all the tastes.
The very phrase &ldquo;<i>cordon bleu</i>&rdquo; (strictly applied only to a woman
cook) arose from an enthusiastic recognition of female merit
by the king himself. Madame du Barry, piqued at his opinion
that only a man could cook to perfection, had a dinner prepared
for him by a <i>cuisinière</i> with such success that the delighted
monarch demanded that the artist should be named, in order
that so precious a <i>cuisinier</i> might be engaged for the royal
household. &ldquo;<i>Allons donc, la France!</i>&rdquo; retorted the ex-grisette,
&ldquo;have I caught you at last? It is no <i>cuisinier</i> at all, but a
<i>cuisinière</i>, and I demand a recompense for her worthy both of
her and of your majesty. Your royal bounty has made my
negro, Zamore, governor of Luciennes, and I cannot accept
less than a <i>cordon bleu</i>&rdquo; (the Royal Order of the <i>Saint Esprit</i>)
&ldquo;for my <i>cuisinière</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French Revolution was temporarily a blow to Parisian
cookery, as to everything else of the <i>ancien régime</i>. &ldquo;Not a
single turbot in the market,&rdquo; was the lament of Grimod de la
Reynière, the great gourmet, and author of the <i>Manuel des
amphitryons</i> (1808). But while it fell heavily on the class of
noble amphitryons it had one remarkable effect on the art
which was epoch-making. It is from that time that we notice
the rise of the Parisian restaurants. To 1770 is ascribed the first
of these, the <i>Champ d&rsquo;oiseau</i> in the rue des Poulies. In 1789
there were a hundred. In 1804 (when the <i>Almanach des gourmands</i>,
the first sustained effort at investing gastronomy with
the dignity of an art, was started) there were between 500
and 600. And in 1814, to such an extent had the restaurants
attracted the culinary talent of Paris, that the allied monarchs,
on arriving there, had to contract with the two brothers Véry
for the supply of their table. Among the great gastronomic
names of Napoleon&rsquo;s day was that of his chancellor Cambacérès,
of whose dinners many stories are told. Robert (the eponym
of the <i>sauce Robert</i>), Rechaud and Mérillion were at this period
esteemed the Raphael, Michelangelo and Rubens of cookery;
while A. Beauvilliers (author of <i>Art des cuisines</i>) and Carême
(author of the <i>Maître d&rsquo;hôtel français</i>, and chef at different
times to the Tsar Alexander I., Talleyrand, George IV. and
Baron Rothschild) were no less celebrated.<a name="FnAnchor_1d" id="FnAnchor_1d" href="#Footnote_1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Perhaps the greatest
name of all in the history of the literature of cookery is that of
Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826), the French judge and
author of the <i>Physiologie du goût</i> (1825), the classic of gastronomy.</p>

<p>In England Louis Eustache Ude, Charles Elmé Francatelli,
and Alexis Soyer carried on the tradition, all being not only cooks
but authors of treatises on the art. The <i>Original</i> (1835) of
Thomas Walker, the Lambeth police magistrate, is another work
which has inspired later pens. Like the <i>Physiologie du goût</i>, it is
no mere cookery-book, but a compound of observation and
philosophy. Among simple hand-books, Mrs Glasse&rsquo;s, Dr
Kitchener&rsquo;s and Mrs Rundell&rsquo;s were standard English works in
the 18th and early 19th centuries; and in France the <i>Cuisinière
de la campagne</i> (1818) went through edition after edition. An
interesting old English work is Dr Pegge&rsquo;s <i>Forme of Cury</i> (1780),
which includes some historical reflections on the subject. &ldquo;We
have some good families in England,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of the name of
Cook or Coke.... Depend upon it, they all originally sprang
from real professional cooks, and they need not be ashamed of
their extraction any more than Porters, Butlers, &amp;c.&rdquo; He points
out that cooks in early days were of some importance; William
the Conqueror bestowed land on his <i>coquorum praepositus</i> and
<i>coquus regius</i>; and Domesday Book records the bestowal of a
manor on Robert Argyllon, by the service of a dish called &ldquo;de
la Groute&rdquo; on the king&rsquo;s coronation day.</p>

<p>At the present time, whatever the local varieties of cooking,
and the difference of national custom, French cooking is admittedly
the ideal of the culinary art, directly we leave the plain
roast and boiled. And the spread of cosmopolitan hotels and
restaurants over England, America and the European continent,
has largely accustomed the whole civilized world to the Parisian
type. The improvements in the appliances and appurtenances of
the kitchen have made the whole world kin in the arts of dining,
but the French chef remains the typical master of his craft.
Schools of cookery have been added to the educational machine.
The literature of the subject has passed beyond enumeration.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to pursue so vast a practical subject into
detail; but the following notes on broiling, roasting, baking,
boiling, stewing and frying may be useful.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Broiling.</i>&mdash;The earliest method of cooking was probably burying
seeds and flesh in hot ashes, a kind of broiling on all the surfaces at
the same time, which when properly done is the most delicate kind
of cooking. Broiling is now done over a clear fire extending at least
2 in. beyond the edges of the gridiron, which should slightly incline
towards the cook. It is usual to rub the bars with a piece of suet
for meat, and chalk for fish, to prevent the thing broiled from being
marked with the bars of the gridiron. In this kind of cookery the
object is to coagulate as quickly as possible all the albumen on the
surface, and seal up the pores of the meat so as to keep in all the
juices and flavour. It is, therefore, necessary thoroughly to warm
the gridiron before putting on the meat, or the heat of the fire is
conducted away while the juices and flavour of the meat run into
the fire. Broiling is a simple kind of cookery, and one well suited
to invalids and persons of delicate appetites. There is no other way
in which small quantities of meat can be so well and so quickly
cooked. Broiling cannot be well done in front of an open fire, because
one side of the meat is exposed to a current of cold air. A pair of
tongs should be used instead of a fork for turning all broiled meat
and fish.</p>

<p><i>Roasting.</i>&mdash;Two conditions are necessary for good roasting&mdash;a
clear bright fire and frequent basting. Next to boiling or stewing
it is the most economical method of cooking. The meat at first
should be placed close to a brisk fire for five minutes to coagulate
the albumen. It should then be drawn back a short distance and
roasted slowly. If a meat screen be used, it should be placed before
the fire to be moderately heated before the meat is put to roast.
The centre of gravity of the fire should be a little above the centre
of gravity of the joint. No kitchen can be complete without an
open range, for it is almost impossible to have a properly roasted
joint in closed kitcheners. The heat radiated from a good open fire
quickly coagulates the albumen on the surface, and thus to a large
extent prevents that which is fluid in the interior from solidifying.
The connective tissue which unites the fibres is gradually converted
into gelatin, and rendered easily soluble. The fibrin and albumen
appear to undergo a higher oxidation and are more readily dissolved.
The fat cells are gradually broken, and the liquid fat unites to a small
extent with the chloride of sodium and the tribasic phosphate of
sodium contained in the serum of the blood. It is easily seen that
roasting by coagulating the external albumen keeps together the
most valuable parts of the meat, till they have gradually and slowly
undergone the desired change. This surface coagulation is not
sufficient to prevent the free access of the oxygen of the surrounding
air. The empyreumatic oils generated on the surface are neither
wholesome nor agreeable, and these are perhaps better removed by
roasting than any other method except broiling. The chief object
is to retain as much as possible all the sapid juicy properties of the
meat, so that at the first cut the gravy flows out of a rich reddish
colour, and this can only be accomplished by a quick coagulation
of the surface albumen. The time for roasting varies slightly with
the kind of meat and the size of the joint. As a rule beef and mutton
require a quarter of an hour to the pound; veal and pork about
17 minutes to the pound. To tell whether the joint is done, press
the fleshy part with a spoon; if the meat yield easily it is done.</p>

<p><i>Baking</i> meat is in many respects objectionable, and should never
be done if any other method is available. The gradual disuse of
open grates for roasting has led to a practice of first baking and then
browning before the fire. This method completely reverses the true
order of cooking by beginning with the lowest temperature and
finishing with the highest. Baked meat has never the delicate
flavour of roast meat, nor is it so digestible. The vapours given off
by the charring of the surface cannot freely escape, and the meat
is cooked in an atmosphere charged with empyreumatic oil. A
brick or earthenware oven is preferable to iron, because the porous
nature of the bricks absorbs a good deal of the vapour. When
potatoes are baked with meat, they should always be first parboiled,
because they take a longer time to bake, and the moisture rising from
the potatoes retards the process of baking, and makes the meat
sodden. A baked meat pie, though not always very digestible, is far
less objectionable than plain baked meat. In the case of a meat pie
the surfaces of the meat are protected by a bad conductor of heat
from that charring of the surface which generates empyreumatic
vapours, and the fat and gravy, gradually rising in temperature,
assist the cooking, and such cooking more nearly resembles stewing
than baking. The process may go on for a long time after the removal
of the meat from the oven, if surrounded with flannel, or some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
bad conductor of heat. The Cornish pasty is the best example of this
kind of cooking. Meat, fish, game, parboiled vegetables, apples or
anything that fancy suggests, are surrounded with a thick flour and
water crust and slowly baked. When removed from the oven, and
packed in layers of flannel, the pasty will keep hot for hours. When
baked dishes contain eggs, it should be remembered that the albumen
becomes harder and more insoluble, according to the time occupied
in cooking. About the same time is required for baking as roasting.</p>

<p><i>Boiling</i> is one of the easiest methods of cooking, but a successful
result depends on a number of conditions which, though
they appear trifling, are nevertheless necessary. The fire must be
watched so as properly to regulate the heat. The saucepan should
be scrupulously clean and have a closely-fitting lid, and be large
enough to hold sufficient water to well cover and surround the meat,
and all scum should be removed as it comes to the surface; the
addition of small quantities of cold water will assist the rising of the
scum. For all cooking purposes clean rain water is to be preferred.
Among cooks a great difference of opinion exists as to whether meat
should be put into cold water and gradually brought to the boiling
point, or should be put into boiling water. This, like many other
unsettled questions in cookery, is best decided by careful scientific
experiment and observation. If a piece of meat be put into water
at a temperature of 60°, and gradually raised to 212°, the meat is
undergoing a gradual loss of its soluble and nutritious properties,
which are dissolved in the water. From the surface to the interior
the albumen is partially dissolved out of the meat, the fibres become
hard and stringy, and the thinner the piece of meat the greater the
loss of all those sapid constituents which make boiled meat savoury,
juicy and palatable. To put meat into cold water is clearly the best
method for making soups and broth; it is the French method of
preparing the <i>pot au feu</i>; but the meat at the end of the operation
has lost much of that juicy sapid property which makes boiled meat
so acceptable. The practice of soaking fresh meat in cold water
before cooking is for the same reasons highly objectionable; if
necessary, wipe it with a clean cloth. But in the case of salted,
smoked and dried meats soaking for several hours is indispensable,
and the water should be occasionally changed. The other method
of boiling meat has the authority of Baron Liebig, who recommends
putting the meat into water when in a state of ebullition, and after
five minutes the saucepan is to be drawn aside, and the contents
kept at a temperature of 162° (50° below boiling). The effect of
boiling water is to coagulate the albumen on the surface of the meat,
which prevents, but not entirely, the juices from passing into the water,
and meat thus boiled has more flavour and has lost much less in
weight. To obtain well-flavoured boiled meat the idea of soups or
broth must be a secondary consideration. It is, however, impossible
to cook a piece of meat in water without extracting some of its juices
and nutriment, and the liquor should in both cases be made into a
soup.</p>

<p><i>Stewing.</i>&mdash;When meat is slowly cooked in a close vessel it is said
to be stewed; this method is generally adopted in the preparation
of made dishes. Different kinds of meat may be used, or only one
kind according to taste. The better the meat the better the stew;
but by carefully stewing the coarsest and roughest parts will become
soft, tender and digestible, which would not be possible by any other
kind of cooking. Odd pieces of meat and trimmings and bones can
often be purchased cheaply, and may be turned into good food by
stewing. Bones, although containing little meat, contain from
39 to 49% of gelatin. The large bones should be broken into small
pieces, and allowed to simmer till every piece is white and dry.
Gelatin is largely used both in the form of jellies and soups. Lean
meat, free from blood, is best for stewing, and, when cut into convenient
pieces, it should be slightly browned in a little butter or
dripping. Constant attention is necessary during this process, to
prevent burning. The meat should be covered with soft water or,
better, a little stock, and set aside to simmer for four or five hours,
according to the nature of the material. When vegetables are used,
these should also be slightly browned and added at intervals, so as
not materially to lower the temperature. Stews may be thickened
by the addition of pearl barley, sago, rice, potatoes, oatmeal, flour,
&amp;c., and flavoured with herbs and condiments according to taste.
Although stewing is usually done in a stewpan or saucepan with a
close-fitting cover, a good stone jar, with a well-fitting lid, is preferable
in the homes of working people. This is better than a metal
saucepan, and can be more easily kept clean; it retains the heat
longer, and can be placed in the oven or covered with hot ashes.
The common red jar is not suitable; it does not stand the heat so
well as a grey jar; and the red glaze inside often gives way in the
presence of salt. The lid of a vessel used for stewing should be removed
as little as possible. An occasional shake will prevent the
meat from sticking. At the end of the operation all the fat should be
carefully removed.</p>

<p><i>Frying.</i>&mdash;Lard, oil, butter, or dripping may be used for frying.
There are two methods of frying&mdash;the dry method, as in frying a
pancake, and the wet method, as when the thing fried is immersed
in a bath of hot fat. In the former case a frying pan is used, in the
other a frying kettle or stewpan. It is usual for most things to have
a wire frying basket; the things to be fried are placed in the basket
and immersed at the proper temperature in the hot fat. The fat
should gradually rise in temperature over a slow fire till it attains
nearly 400° Fahr. Great care is required to fry properly. If the temperature
is too low the things immersed in the fat are not fried,
but soddened; if, on the other hand, the temperature is too high,
they are charred. The temperature of the fat varies slightly with
the nature of things to be fried. Fish, cutlets, croquets, rissoles and
fritters are well fried at a temperature of 380° Fahr. Potatoes, chops
and white bait are better fried at a temperature of 400° Fahr. Care
must be taken not to lower the temperature too much by introducing
too many things. The most successful frying is when the fat rises
two or three degrees during the frying. Fried things should be of a

been used for fish it must be kept for fish. It is customary first to
use fat for croquets, rissoles, fritters and other delicate things, and
then to take it for fish. Everything fried in fat should be placed
on bibulous paper to absorb any fat on the surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOKWORTHY, WILLIAM<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1705-1780), English potter,
famous for his discovery of the existence of china-clay and china-stone
in Cornwall, and as the first manufacturer of a porcelain
similar in nature to the Chinese, from English materials, was
born at Kingsbridge, Devon, of Quaker parents who were in
humble circumstances. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed
to a London apothecary named Bevans, and he afterwards
returned to the neighbourhood of his birthplace, and carried
on business at Plymouth with the co-operation of his master,
under the title of Bevans &amp; Cookworthy. The manufacture of
porcelain was at the time attracting great attention in England,
and while the factories at Bow, Chelsea, Worcester and Derby
were introducing the artificial glassy porcelain, Cookworthy,
following the accounts of Père d&rsquo;Entrecolles, spent many years
in searching for English materials similar to those used by the
Chinese. From 1745 onwards he seems to have travelled over
the greater portion of Cornwall and Devon in search of these
minerals, and he finally located them in the parish of St Stephen&rsquo;s
near to St Austell. With a certain amount of financial assistance
from Mr Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc (afterwards Lord Camelford)
he established the Plymouth China Factory at least as early as
1768. The factory was removed to Bristol about 1770, and the
business was afterwards sold to Richard Champion and others
and became the well-known Bristol Porcelain Manufactory.
Apart from its historic interest there is little to be said for the
Plymouth porcelain. Technically it was often imperfect, and
its artistic treatment was never of a high order. But Cookworthy
deserves to be remembered for his discovery of those abundant
supplies of English clay and rocks which form the foundation
of English porcelain and fine earthenware (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOLIE,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Cooly</span> (from Koli or Kuli, an aboriginal race of
western India; or perhaps from Tamil <i>k&#363;li</i>, hire, <i>i.e.</i> one hired),
a term generally applied to Asiatic labourers belonging to
the unskilled class as opposed to the artisan, and employed in a
special sense to designate those natives of India and China who
leave their country under contracts of service to work as labourers
abroad. After the abolition of slavery much difficulty was
found in obtaining cheap labour for tropical plantations. The
emancipated black was unwilling to engage in field labour,
while the white man was physically incapable of so doing.
Recourse was had to the overpeopled empires of China and
India, as the most likely sources from which to obtain that
supply of workers upon which the very existence of some colonies,
notably in the West Indies, depended.</p>

<p>The first public recognition of the coolie traffic was in 1844,
when the British colony of Guiana made provision for the
encouragement of Chinese immigration. About the
same time both Peru and Cuba began to look to China
<span class="sidenote">Chinese coolies.</span>
as likely to furnish an efficient substitute for the
negro bondsman. Agents armed with consular commissions
from Peru appeared in Chinese ports, where they collected and
sent away shiploads of coolies. Each one was bound to serve
the Peruvian planter to whom he might be assigned for seven
or eight years, at fixed wages, generally about 17s. a month,
food, clothes and lodging being provided. From 1847 to 1854
coolie emigration went on briskly without attracting much
notice, but it gradually came to light that circumstances of great
cruelty attended the trade. The transport ships were badly
equipped and overcrowded, and many coolies died before the
end of the voyage. On arrival in Cuba or Peru the survivors were
sold by auction in the open market to the highest bidders, who
held them virtually as slaves for seven years instead of for life.
Particularly terrible was the lot of those who, contrary to their
agreements, had been sent to labour in the foul guano pits of
the Chincha islands, where they were forced to toil in gangs,
each under the charge of an overseer armed with a cowhide lash.
In 1860 it was calculated that of the four thousand coolies who
had been fraudulently consigned to the guano pits of Peru not
one had survived. The greater number of them had committed
suicide. In 1854 the British governor of Hong-Kong issued a
proclamation forbidding British subjects or vessels to engage
in the transport of coolies to the Chinchas. Technically this was
<i>ultra vires</i> on his part, but his policy was confirmed by the Chinese
Passengers&rsquo; Act 1855, which put an end to the more abominable
phase of the traffic. After that no British ship was allowed to
sail on more than a week&rsquo;s voyage with more than twenty coolies
on board, unless her master had complied with certain very
stringent regulations.</p>

<p>The consequence of this was that the business of shipping
coolies for Peru was transferred to the Portuguese settlement
of Macao. There the Peruvian and Cuban &ldquo;labour-agents&rdquo;
established depôts, which they unblushingly called &ldquo;barracoons,&rdquo;
the very term used in the West African slave trade. In these
places coolies were &ldquo;received,&rdquo; or in plain words, imprisoned
and kept under close guard until a sufficient number were
collected for export. Some of these were decoyed by fraudulent
promises of profitable employment. Others were kidnapped
by piratical junks hired to scour the neighbouring coasts. Many
were bought from leaders of turbulent native factions, only too
glad to sell the prisoners they captured whilst waging their
internecine wars. The procurador or registrar-general of Macao
went through the form of certifying the contracts; but his
inspection was practically useless. After the war of 1856-1857
this masked slave trade pushed its agencies into Whampoa
and Canton. In April 1859, however, the whole mercantile
community of the latter port rose up in indignation against it,
and transmitted such strong representations to the British
embassy in China, that steps were taken to mitigate the evil.
New regulations were from time to time passed by the Portuguese
authorities for the purpose of minimizing the horrors of the
Macao trade. They seem, however, to have been systematically
evaded, and to have been practically inoperative. At Canton and
Hong-Kong the coolie trade was put under various regulations,
which in the latter port worked well only when the profits of
&ldquo;head-money&rdquo; were ruined. In March 1866 the representatives
of the governments of France, England and China drew up a
convention for the regulation of the Canton trade, which had
an unfortunate effect. It left head-money, the source of most
of the abuses, comparatively untouched. It enacted that
every coolie must at the end of a five years&rsquo; engagement have
his return passage-money paid to him. The West Indian colonies
at once objected to this. They wanted permanent not temporary
settlers. They could not afford to burden the coolie&rsquo;s expensive
contract with return passage-money, so they declined to accept
emigrants on these terms. Thus a legalized coolie trade between
the West Indies and China was extinguished. Thereafter the
coolie supply for British colonies was drawn exclusively from
India, until 1904, when an exception was made in the case of
the Transvaal. Under a convention drawn up in that year
between the United Kingdom and China over fifty thousand
indentured Chinese labourers were engaged on three years&rsquo;
contracts to work in the Witwatersrand gold mines (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Transvaal</a></span>). To the Malay states and other parts of eastern
Asia there is an extensive yearly migration of Chinese coolies.
This migration, however, is not under contract. From Amoy
alone some seventy-five thousand coolies yearly migrate to
Singapore and the Straits Settlements, whence they are drafted
for labour purposes in every direction.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to say when the Indian coolie trade began.
Before the end of the 18th century Tamil labourers from southern
India were wont to emigrate to the Straits Settlements,
and they also flocked to Tenasserim from the other
<span class="sidenote">Indian coolies.</span>
side of the Bay of Bengal after the conquest had
produced a demand for labour. The first regularly recorded
attempt at organizing coolie emigration from India took place
in 1834, when forty coolies were exported to Mauritius; but it
was not until 1836 that the Indian government decided to put
the trade under official regulations. In 1837 an emigration law
was passed for all the territories of the East India Company,
providing that a permit must be obtained from government
for every shipment of coolies, that all contracts should terminate
in five years, that a return passage should be guaranteed, that
the terms of his contract should be carefully explained to each
coolie, and that the emigrant ship should only carry one coolie
for every ton and a half of burden. Then as now the Indian
government watched the deportation of labour from their
dominions with jealous and anxious care, and when in 1838 it
was found that upwards of twenty-five thousand natives had,
up to that year, gone from all parts of India to Mauritius, the
government became somewhat alarmed at the dimensions
which the traffic was assuming. Brougham and the anti-slavery
party denounced the trade as a revival of slavery, and the
Bengal government suspended it in order to investigate its
alleged abuses. The nature of these may be guessed when it is
said that the inquiry condemned the fraudulent methods of
recruiting then in vogue, and the brutal treatment which coolies
often received from ship captains and masters. In 1842 steps
were taken formally to reopen the coolie trade with Mauritius,
and in 1844 emigration to the West Indies was sanctioned by
the Indian government. In 1847 Ceylon was separated from
India, and her labour supply was cut off; but this accident was
soon remedied, the Ceylon government adopting protective
regulations for the coolies.</p>

<p>Emigration of coolies under contract to labour outside India
is now regulated by the Emigration Act of 1883 and the rules
issued under its provisions, the only exceptions being in respect
of emigrants to Ceylon and the Straits Settlements and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
adjoining states, or those engaged by the British government
for employment in east and central Africa. By section 8 of this
<span class="sidenote">Modern regulations.</span>
act natives of India are permitted to emigrate under
labour contracts only to such countries as have
satisfied the government of India that sufficient provision
is made for the protection of the emigrants. A
country which is duly empowered under the act to receive
emigrants may appoint an agent, residing in India, who is
responsible for the due observance of the provisions of the law.
These agents are under the general supervision of the protector
of emigrants. As emigrants have to be recruited at great
distances from the port of embarkation, recruiters are appointed
by the agents and licensed by the protector. The conduct of
these subordinates is minutely regulated. Every precaution
is taken to let the emigrant know the exact terms on which
he is hired, and to ensure good treatment in the interval between
registration and embarkation. Coolies are shipped for the
most part from Calcutta and Madras, but of recent years large
numbers bound for Mombasa and the Seychelles left from
Bombay and Karachi. Both the coolies themselves and the
depôt are medically inspected. Only those physically fit are
allowed to embark. The vessels for their conveyance are
licensed and inspected by the local government. The terms
on which emigrants are recruited are settled beforehand by
convention with the colonies concerned, and are embodied in
ordinances passed by the local legislatures. They vary in detail,
but their main provisions relate to the rights and obligations
of the emigrants, including the grant of a return passage on the
expiry of a specified period, usually ten years. The British
colonies to which coolies were exported in the decade 1891-1901
were British Guiana, Trinidad, St Lucia, Jamaica, Mauritius,
the Seychelles Islands, Fiji, East Africa and Natal; the only
non-British country was Dutch Guiana. Emigration to the
French colonies, including Réunion has been forbidden by the
government of India since 1886, but there still remain in those
colonies some of the former emigrants, and the questions of their
treatment and repatriation have frequently formed the subject
of representations to the French authorities.</p>

<p>The number of Indian coolies resident in the various British
colonies in 1900 was 625,000, of which the largest numbers were
265,000 in Mauritius and 125,000 in British Guiana.
There were still 13,800 in Réunion. The regulations
<span class="sidenote">The British colonies.</span>
governing coolie labour in British Guiana may be taken
as typical for the British colonies generally. They are
contained in the Labour Ordinance of 1873, which was amended
by the ordinances of 1875, 1876, 1886 and 1887. Under these
ordinances an immigration agent-general is appointed, to whom
medical officers and recruiting agents are responsible, and the
emigrants are allotted by him to the separate estates. They
regulate the hours of work, the rate of wages, and the general
treatment of the coolies, the nature of house and hospital
accommodation, the terms of re-enlistment and the conditions of
marriage amongst the coolies themselves. The coolies returning
from the British colonies to India in 1901 possessed average
savings of £19.</p>

<p>During the construction of the Uganda railway large numbers
of coolies were recruited in the Punjab and exported from
Karachi to Mombasa. During the decade 1891-1901
the number of these emigrants was 33,000; but on the
<span class="sidenote">British East and South Africa.</span>
completion of the line the emigration practically
stopped, while in 1901-1902 there were over 6000
emigrants who returned to India. Some, however, settled
in East Africa. Coolies are also exported for government employment
in Nyasaland. In Natal the Indian population had
by 1904 reached over 100,000 and slightly outnumbered the
whites. Many of the coolies had become permanent residents in
the colony (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Natal</a></span>).</p>

<p>According to the census of 1901 there were 775,844 foreigners
in Assam, of whom no fewer than 645,000 or 83% were brought
into the province as garden coolies. The recruiting of these
coolies is regulated by Act VI. of 1901, which provides that a
labour agreement may be entered into for four years, and includes
a penal clause, under which a coolie deserting or refusing to work
may be punished with imprisonment. The coolies can also give
<span class="sidenote">Assam, Ceylon and Burma.</span>
an agreement under Act XIII. of 1859, by which they
are only liable to civil action for breach of contract.
The latter are called non-act coolies. This system of
immigration has made tea-planting the most important
industry in Assam, and has greatly increased the prosperity of
the province. Migration to Ceylon and Burma takes place
chiefly from the Madras ports, and is of a seasonal and temporary
character. The tea estates and pearl fisheries of Ceylon, and the
town work and harvesting in Burma attract large numbers of
Tamil labourers. The respective numbers embarking in 1901
were 117,000 for Ceylon, 84,000 for Burma and 27,000 for the
Straits Settlements. In Ceylon there is no system of recruitment
like that for the Assam tea-gardens. The coolies come in gangs,
each under its own headman, with whom the planter deals
exclusively, leaving him to make his own arrangements with the
individual coolies. The coolies are mostly carried in small
sailing vessels from the ports of Madura and Tanjore, and the
number who permanently settle in Ceylon is not very great.</p>

learned something of the use of oil-colours, and painted the
picture on a canvas hung against the stable wall. His master
bought it and encouraged him to continue in his efforts. He
accordingly began to copy prints of horses, and was introduced
to Benjamin Marshall, the animal painter, who took him
into his studio, and seems to have introduced him to the
<i>Sporting Magazine</i>, an illustrated periodical to which he was himself
a contributor. In 1814 he exhibited his &ldquo;Tam O&rsquo;Shanter,&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">COOPER, SIR ASTLEY PASTON<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1768-1841), English surgeon,
was born at the village of Brooke in Norfolk on the 23rd of
August 1768. His father, Dr Samuel Cooper, was a clergyman of
the Church of England; his mother was the author of several
novels. At the age of sixteen he was sent to London and placed
under Henry Cline (1750-1827), surgeon to St Thomas&rsquo;s hospital.
From the first he devoted himself to the study of anatomy, and
had the privilege of attending the lectures of John Hunter. In
1789 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at St Thomas&rsquo;s
hospital, where in 1791 he became joint lecturer with Cline in
anatomy and surgery, and in 1800 he was appointed surgeon to
Guy&rsquo;s hospital, on the death of his uncle, William Cooper. In
1802 he received the Copley medal for two papers read before the
Royal Society of London on the destruction of the <i>membrana
tympani</i>; and in 1805 he was elected a fellow of that society.
In the same year he took an active part in the formation of the
Medico-Chirurgical Society, and published in the first volume of
its <i>Transactions</i> an account of an attempt to tie the common
carotid artery for aneurism. In 1804 he brought out the first,
and in 1807 the second, part of his great work on hernia, which
added so largely to his reputation that in 1813 his annual professional
income rose to £21,000 sterling. In the same year he
was appointed professor of comparative anatomy to the Royal
College of Surgeons and was very popular as a lecturer. In 1817
he performed his famous operation of tying the abdominal aorta
for aneurism; and in 1820 he removed a wen from the head of
George IV., and about six months afterwards received a
baronetcy, which, as he had no son, was to descend to his
nephew and adopted son, Astley Cooper. He served as president
of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1827 and again in 1836, and
he was elected a vice-president of the Royal Society in 1830. He
died on the 12th of February 1841 in London, and was interred,

He received his education at a private school in Reading. In
1826 he fixed his residence at Cambridge, and in 1836 was elected
coroner of the borough. Four years later he was admitted a
solicitor, and in course of time he acquired an extensive practice,
but his taste and inclination ultimately led him to devote almost
the whole of his time to literary research, and especially the
elucidation of the history of the university of Cambridge. In
1849 he resigned the office of borough coroner on being elected

voyage or two in a merchant vessel, to perfect himself in seamanship,
and obtaining his lieutenancy, he married and resigned
his commission (1811). He settled in Westchester county, N.Y.,
the &ldquo;Neutral Ground&rdquo; of his earliest American romance, and
produced anonymously (1820) his first book, <i>Precaution</i>, a novel
of the fashionable school. This was followed (1821) by <i>The Spy</i>,
which was very successful at the date of issue; <i>The Pioneers</i>
(1823), the first of the &ldquo;Leatherstocking&rdquo; series; and <i>The
Pilot</i> (1824), a bold and dashing sea-story. The next was <i>Lionel
Lincoln</i> (1825), a feeble and unattractive work; and this was
succeeded in 1826 by the famous <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>, a book
that is often quoted as its author&rsquo;s masterpiece. Quitting
America for Europe he published at Paris <i>The Prairie</i> (1826),
the best of his books in nearly all respects, and <i>The Red Rover</i>,
(1828), by no means his worst.</p>

<p>At this period the unequal and uncertain talent of Cooper
would seem to have been at its best. These excellent novels
were, however, succeeded by one very inferior, <i>The Wept of
Wish-ton-Wish</i> (1829); by <i>The Notions of a Travelling Bachelor</i>
(1828), an uninteresting book; and by <i>The Waterwitch</i> (1830),
one of the poorest of his many sea-stories. In 1830 he entered
the lists as a party writer, defending in a series of letters to the
<i>National</i>, a Parisian journal, the United States against a string
of charges brought against them by the <i>Revue Britannique</i>;
and for the rest of his life he continued skirmishing in
print, sometimes for the national interest, sometimes for that
of the individual, and not infrequently for both at once. This
opportunity of making a political confession of faith appears
not only to have fortified him in his own convictions, but to have
inspired him with the idea of imposing them on the public
through the medium of his art. His next three novels, <i>The
Bravo</i> (1831), <i>The Heidenmauer</i> (1832) and <i>The Headsman: or
the Abbaye of Vigneron</i> (1833), were designed to exalt the people
at the expense of the aristocracy. Of these the first is by no
means a bad story, but the others are among the dullest ever
written; all were widely read on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>In 1833 Cooper returned to America, and immediately published
<i>A Letter to my Countrymen</i>, in which he gave his own
version of the controversy he had been engaged in, and passed
some sharp censure on his compatriots for their share in it.
This attack he followed up with <i>The Monikins</i> (1835) and <i>The
American Democrat</i> (1835); with several sets of notes on his
travels and experiences in Europe, among which may be remarked
his <i>England</i> (1837), in three volumes, a burst of vanity and ill-temper;
and with <i>Homeward Bound</i>, and <i>Home as Found</i> (1838),
noticeable as containing a highly idealized portrait of himself.
All these books tended to increase the ill-feeling between author
and public; the Whig press was virulent and scandalous in its
comments, and Cooper plunged into a series of actions for libel.
Victorious in all of them, he returned to his old occupation
with something of his old vigour and success. A <i>History of the
Navy of the United States</i> (1839), supplemented (1846) by a set of
<i>Lives of Distinguished American Naval Officers</i>, was succeeded
by <i>The Pathfinder</i> (1840), a good &ldquo;Leatherstocking&rdquo; novel;
by <i>Mercedes of Castile</i> (1840); <i>The Deerslayer</i> (1841); by <i>The
Two Admirals</i> and by <i>Wing and Wing</i> (1842); by <i>Wyandotte,
The History of a Pocket Handkerchief</i>, and <i>Ned Myers</i> (1843);
and by <i>Afloat and Ashore, or the Adventures of Miles Wallingford</i>
(1844). From pure fiction, however, he turned again to the
combination of art and controversy in which he had achieved
distinction, and in the two <i>Littlepage Manuscripts</i> (1845-1846)
he fought with a great deal of vigour. His next novel was <i>The
Crater, or Vulcan&rsquo;s Peak</i> (1847), in which he attempted to introduce
supernatural machinery with indifferent success; and this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
was succeeded by <i>Oak Openings</i> and <i>Jack Tier</i> (1848), the latter
a curious <i>rifacimento</i> of <i>The Red Rover</i>; by <i>The Sea Lions</i> (1849);
and finally by <i>The Ways of the Hour</i> (1850), another novel with
a purpose, and his last book. He died of dropsy on the 14th of
September 1851 at Cooperstown, New York. His daughter,
Susan Fenimore Cooper (1813-1894), was known as an author
and philanthropist.</p>

<p>Cooper was certainly one of the most popular authors that
have ever written. His stories have been translated into nearly
all the languages of Europe and into some of those of Asia.
Balzac admired him greatly, but with discrimination; Victor
Hugo pronounced him greater than the great master of modern
romance, and this verdict was echoed by a multitude of inferior
readers, who were satisfied with no title for their favourite less
than that of &ldquo;the American Scott.&rdquo; As a satirist and observer
he is simply the &ldquo;Cooper who&rsquo;s written six volumes to prove
he&rsquo;s as good as a Lord&rdquo; of Lowell&rsquo;s clever portrait; his enormous
vanity and his irritability find vent in a sort of dull violence,
which is exceedingly tiresome. It is only as a novelist that he
deserves consideration. His qualities are not those of the great
masters of fiction; but he had an inexhaustible imagination,
some faculty for simple combination of incident, a homely tragic
force which is very genuine and effective, and up to a certain
point a fine narrative power. His literary training was inadequate;
his vocabulary is limited and his style awkward
and pretentious; and he had a fondness for moralizing tritely
and obviously, which mars his best passages. In point of conception,
each of his three-and-thirty novels is either absolutely
good or is possessed of a certain amount of merit; but hitches
occur in all, so that every one of them is remarkable rather in its
episodes than as a whole. Nothing can be more vividly told than
the escape of the Yankee man-of-war through the shoals and
from the English cruisers in <i>The Pilot</i>, but there are few things
flatter in the range of fiction than the other incidents of the novel.
It is therefore with some show of reason that <i>The Last of the
Mohicans</i>, which as a chain of brilliantly narrated episodes is
certainly the least faulty in this matter of sustained excellence
of execution, should be held to be the best of his works.</p>

<p>The personages of his drama are rather to be accounted as
so much painted cloth and cardboard, than as anything approaching
the nature of men and women. As a creator of aught but
romantic incident, indeed, Cooper&rsquo;s claims to renown must rest
on the fine figure of the Leatherstocking, and, in a less degree,
on that of his friend and companion, the Big Serpent. The
latter has many and obvious merits, not the least of which is
the pathos shed about him in his last incarnation as the Indian
John of <i>The Pioneers</i>. Natty Bumpo, however, is a creation
of no common unity and consistency. There are lapses and
flaws, and Natty is made to say things which only Cooper, in
his most verbosely didactic vein, could have uttered. But on
the whole the impression left is good and true. In the dignity
and simplicity of the old backwoodsman there is something
almost Hebraic. With his naïve vanity and strong reverent
piety, his valiant wariness, his discriminating cruelty, his fine
natural sense of right and wrong, his rough limpid honesty, his
kindly humour, his picturesque dialect, and his rare skill in
woodcraft, he has all the breadth and roundness of a type and
all the eccentricities and peculiarities of a portrait.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPER, PETER<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1791-1883), American manufacturer,
inventor and philanthropist, was born in New York city on the
12th of February 1791. His grandfathers and his father served
in the War of American Independence. He received practically
no schooling, but worked with his father at hat-making in New
York city, at brewing in Peekskill, at brick-making in Catskill,
and again at brewing in Newburgh. At seventeen he was
apprenticed to a coach-builder in New York city. On coming of
age he got employment at Hempstead, Long Island, making
machines for shearing cloth; three years afterwards he set up
in this business for himself, having bought the sole right to
manufacture such machinery in the state of New York. Business
prospered during the War of 1812, but fell off after the peace.
He turned his shop into a furniture factory; soon sold this and
for a short time was engaged in the grocery business on the site
of the present Bible House, opposite Cooper Union; and then
invested in a glue and isinglass factory, situated for twenty-one
years in Manhattan (where the Park Avenue Hotel was built
later) and then in Brooklyn. About 1828 he built the Canton Iron
Works in Baltimore, Maryland, the foundation of his great
fortune. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio railway was to cross his property,
and, after various inventions aiming to do away with the locomotive
crank and thus save two-fifths of the steam, in 1830 he
designed and constructed (largely after plans made two years
before) the first steam locomotive built in America; though
only a small model it proved the practicability of using steam
power for working that line. The &ldquo;Tom Thumb,&rdquo; as Cooper
called the locomotive, was about the size of a modern hand-car;
as the natural draft was far from sufficient, Cooper devised a
blowing apparatus. Selling his Baltimore works, he built, in
1836, in partnership with his brother Thomas, a rolling mill in
New York; in 1845 he removed it to Trenton, New Jersey, where
iron structural beams were first made in 1854 and the Bessemer
process first tried in America in 1856; and at Philippsburg,
New Jersey, he built the largest blast furnace in the country at
that time. He built other foundries at Ringwood, New Jersey,
and at Durham, Pennsylvania; bought iron mines in northern
New Jersey, and carried the ore thence by railways to his mills.
Actively interested with Cyrus Field in the laying of the first
Atlantic cable, he was president of the New York, Newfoundland
&amp; London Telegraph Company, and his frequent cash
advances made the success of the company possible; he was
president of the North American Telegraph Company also,
which controlled more than one-half of the telegraph lines of the
United States. For his work in advancing the iron trade he
received the Bessemer gold medal from the Iron and Steel
Institute of Great Britain in 1879. He took a prominent part in
educational affairs, strongly opposed the Roman Catholic claims
for public funds for parochial schools, and conducted the
campaign of the Free School Society to its successful issue in
1842, when a state law was passed forbidding the support from
public funds of any &ldquo;religious sectarian doctrine.&rdquo; He is
probably best known, however, as the founder of the Cooper
Union (<i>q.v.</i>). Cooper was an early advocate of the emancipation
and the enlistment in the Union army of Southern negroes, and
he upheld the administration of Lincoln. Though he had been a
hard-money Democrat, he joined the Greenback party after the
Civil War, and in 1876 was its candidate for the presidency, but
received only 81,740 out of the 8,412,833 votes cast. He died in
New York city on the 4th of April 1883. He published <i>The
Political and Financial Opinions of Peter Cooper, with an Autobiography
of his Early Life</i> (1877), and <i>Ideas for a Science of
Good Government, in Addresses, Letters and Articles on a Strictly
National Currency, Tariff and Civil Service</i> (1883).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPER, SAMUEL<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (1609-1672), English miniature painter.
This artist was undoubtedly the greatest painter of miniatures
who ever lived. He is believed to have been born in London,
and was a nephew of John Hoskins, the miniature painter, by
whom he was educated. He lived in Henrietta St., Covent Garden,
and frequented the Covent Garden Coffee-House. Pepys, who
makes many references to him, tells us he was an excellent
musician, playing well upon the lute, and also a good linguist,
speaking French with ease. According to other contemporary
writers, he was a short, stout man, of a ruddy countenance. He
married one Christiana, whose portrait is at Welbeck Abbey, and
he had one daughter. In 1668 he was instructed by Pepys to
paint a portrait of Mrs Pepys, for which he charged £30. He is
known to have painted also the portrait of John Aubrey,
which was presented in 1691 to the Ashmolean Museum, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
learn from his correspondence with John Ray, the naturalist.
Evelyn refers to him in 1662, when, on the occasion of the visit
that the diarist paid to the king, Cooper was drawing the royal
face and head for the new coinage.</p>

<p>Magnificent examples of his work are to be found at Windsor
Castle, Belvoir Castle, Montague House, Welbeck Abbey, Ham
House, the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam and in the collection of
Mr J. Pierpont Morgan. His largest miniature is in the possession
of the duke of Richmond and Gordon at Goodwood. A piece
of the artist&rsquo;s handwriting is to be seen at the back of one of
his miniatures in the Welbeck Abbey collection, and one of his
drawings in black chalk is in the University Gallery at Oxford.
His own portrait of himself is in the collection of Mr J. Pierpont
Morgan.</p>

<p>The date of his death has been handed down by a record in the
diary of Mary Beale, the miniature painter; and in some letters
from Mr Charles Manners, addressed to Lord Roos, dated 1672,
now amongst the duke of Rutland&rsquo;s papers at Belvoir, the writer
refers to Cooper&rsquo;s serious illness on the 4th of May, and to his
doubt as to whether the artist would ever recover. Mary Beale&rsquo;s
reference to his decease is in the following words: &ldquo;Sunday,
May 5, 1672&mdash;Mr Samuel Cooper, the most famous limner
of the world for a face, dyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPER<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Couper</span>), <span class="bold">THOMAS</span> (c. 1517-1594), English bishop
and writer, was born in Oxford, where he was educated at
Magdalen College. He became master of Magdalen College
school, and afterwards practised as a physician in Oxford.
His literary career began in 1548, when he compiled, or rather
edited, a Latin dictionary <i>Bibliotheca Eliotae</i>, and in 1549 he
published a continuation of Thomas Lanquet&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle of the
World</i>. This work, known as <i>Cooper&rsquo;s Chronicle</i>, covers the
period from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 17 to the time of writing, and was reprinted in
1560 and 1565. In 1565 appeared the first edition of his greatest
work, <i>Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae</i>, and this was
followed by three other editions. Queen Elizabeth was greatly
pleased with the <i>Thesaurus</i>, generally known as <i>Cooper&rsquo;s Dictionary</i>;
and its author, who had been ordained about 1559, was made
dean of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1567. Two years later he
became dean of Gloucester, in 1571 bishop of Lincoln and in 1584
bishop of Winchester. Cooper was a stout controversialist; he
defended the practice and precept of the Church of England
against the Roman Catholics on the one hand and against the
Martin Marprelate writings and the Puritans on the other. He
took some part, the exact extent of which is disputed, in the
persecution of religious recusants in his diocese, and died at
Winchester on the 29th of April 1594.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">COOPER, THOMAS<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1759-1840), American educationalist
and political philosopher, was born in London, England, on the
22nd of October 1759, and educated at Oxford. Threatened
with prosecution at home because of his active sympathy with
the French Revolution, he emigrated to America about 1793,
and began the practice of law in Northumberland county,
Pennsylvania. He was president-judge of the Fourth District
of Pennsylvania in 1806-1811. Like his friend Joseph Priestley,
who was then living in Northumberland, he sympathized with
the Anti-Federalists, and took part in the agitation against the
Sedition Act, and for a newspaper attack in 1799 on President
John Adams, Cooper was convicted, fined and imprisoned for
libel. Like Priestley, Cooper was very highly esteemed by
Thomas Jefferson, who secured for him the appointment as
first professor of natural science and law in the University of
Virginia&mdash;a position which Cooper was forced to resign under
the fierce attack made on him by the Virginia clergy. After
filling the chair of chemistry in Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa.
(1811-1814), and in the University of Pennsylvania (1818-1819),
he became professor of chemistry in South Carolina College, at
Columbia, in 1819, and afterwards gave instruction in political
economy also. In 1820 he became acting president of this institution,
and was president from 1821 until 1833, when he resigned owing
to the opposition within the state to his liberal religious views.
In December 1834, owing to continued opposition, he resigned
his professorship. He had been formally tried for infidelity in
1832. He was a born agitator: John Adams described him as
&ldquo;a learned, ingenious, scientific and talented madcap.&rdquo; Before
his college classes, in public lectures, and in numerous pamphlets,
he constantly preached the doctrine of free trade, and tried to
show that the protective system was especially burdensome to
the South. His remedy was state action. Each state, he contended,
was a sovereign power and was in duty bound to protest
against the tyrannical acts of the Federal government. He
exercised considerable influence in preparing the people of
South Carolina for nullification and secession; in fact he preceded
Calhoun in advocating a practical application of the state
sovereignty principle. The last years of his life were spent in
preparing an edition of the Statutes at Large of the state, which
was completed by David James McCord (1797-1855) and published
in ten volumes (1836-1841). Dr Cooper died in Columbia
on the 11th of May 1840. As a philosopher he was a follower of
Hartley, Erasmus Darwin, Priestley and Broussais; he was a
physiological materialist, and a severe critic of Scotch metaphysics.
Among his publications are <i>Political Essays</i> (1800);
<i>An English Version of the Institutes of Justinian</i> (1812); <i>Lectures
on the Elements of Political Economy</i> (1826); <i>A Treatise on the
Law of Libel and the Liberty of the Press</i> (1830); and a translation
of Broussais&rsquo; <i>On Irritation and Insanity</i> (1831), with which
were printed his own essays, &ldquo;The Scripture Doctrine of Materialism,&rdquo;
&ldquo;View of the Metaphysical and Physiological Arguments
in favour of Materialism,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outline of the Doctrine of the
Association of Ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPER, THOMAS<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (1805-1892), English Chartist and writer,
the son of a working dyer, was born at Leicester on the 20th of
March 1805. After his father&rsquo;s death his mother began business
as a dyer and fancy box-maker at Gainsborough. Young
Cooper was apprenticed to a shoemaker. He had a passion for
knowledge; studied Greek, Latin and Hebrew in his spare time;
and in 1827 gave up cobbling to become a schoolmaster, and,
later, a Methodist preacher. His affairs did not prosper, and
after going to Lincoln, where he obtained work on a local newspaper,
he came to London in 1839. Here he became assistant
to a second-hand bookseller, but in 1840 he joined the staff of
the <i>Leicestershire Mercury</i>. His support of the Chartist movement
obliged him to resign his position, but he undertook to
edit <i>The Midland Counties Illuminator</i>, a Chartist journal, in
1841. He became a leader of the extreme Chartist party, and
for his action in urging on the strike of 1842 he was imprisoned
in Stafford gaol for two years. Here he produced <i>The Purgatory
of Suicides</i>, a political epic in ten books, embodying the radical
ideas of the time. In his efforts to publish this work after his
liberation he came under the notice of Benjamin Disraeli and
Douglas Jerrold. Through Jerrold&rsquo;s help it appeared in 1845,
and Cooper then turned his attention to lecturing upon historical
and educational subjects. In 1856 he suddenly renounced the
free-thinking doctrines which he had held for many years, and
became a lecturer on Christian evidences. He died at Lincoln
on the 15th of July 1892. Among his other works may be
mentioned the <i>Bridge of History over the Gulf of Time</i> (1871)
and the <i>Life of Thomas Cooper, written by Himself</i> (1872).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPER, THOMAS SIDNEY<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1803-1902), English painter,
was born at Canterbury on the 20th of September 1803. In
very early childhood he showed in many ways the strength of his
artistic inclinations, but as the circumstances of his family did
not admit of his receiving any systematic training, he began before
he was twelve years old to work in the shop of a coach painter.
A little later he obtained employment as a scene painter; and
he alternated between these two occupations for about eight
years. But the desire to become an artist continued to influence
him, and all his spare moments were given up to drawing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
painting from nature. At the age of twenty he went to London,
drew for a while in the British Museum, and was admitted as a
student of the Royal Academy. He then returned to Canterbury,
where he was able to earn a living as a drawing-master and by
the sale of sketches and drawings. In 1827 he settled in Brussels;
but four years later he returned to London to live, and by
showing his first picture at the Royal Academy (1833) began an
unprecedentedly prolonged career as an exhibitor. Cooper&rsquo;s
name is mainly associated with pictures of cattle or sheep, and
the most notable of the many hundred he produced are: &ldquo;A
Summer&rsquo;s Noon&rdquo; (1836), &ldquo;A Drover&rsquo;s Halt on the Fells&rdquo;
(1838), &ldquo;A Group in the Meadows&rdquo; (1845), &ldquo;The Half-past
One o&rsquo;Clock Charge at Waterloo&rdquo; (1847), &ldquo;The Shepherd&rsquo;s
Sabbath&rdquo; (1866), &ldquo;The Monarch of the Meadows&rdquo; (1873),
&ldquo;Separated but not Divorced&rdquo; (1874), &ldquo;Isaac&rsquo;s Substitute&rdquo;
(1880), &ldquo;Pushing off for Tilbury Fort&rdquo; (1884), &ldquo;On a Farm
in East Kent&rdquo; (1889), &ldquo;Return to the Farm, Milking Time&rdquo;
(1897). He was elected A.R.A. in 1845 and R.A. in 1867. He
presented to his native place, in 1882, the Sidney Cooper Art
Gallery, built on the site of the house in which he was born.
He wrote his reminiscences, under the title of <i>My Life</i>, in 1890;
and died on the 7th of February 1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPERAGE<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Coperage</span> (Flemish and Dutch <i>kooper</i>, a
trader, dealer), a system of traffic in spirituous liquors, tobacco
and other articles amongst the fishermen in the North Sea. The
practice began in the middle of the 19th century, when Flemish
and Dutch <i>koopers</i> frequented the fishing fleets for the purpose of
barter. Trading first in tobacco, they extended their operations,
and soon became practically floating grog-shops.</p>

<p>The demoralizing nature of the traffic was brought to the
public notice in 1881, and a convention was held at the Hague in
1882 to consider means of remedying the abuses. In 1887 Great
Britain, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France and the Netherlands
signed an agreement to prevent the sale or purchase of
spirituous liquors among fishermen at sea. In Great Britain an
act (the North Sea Fisheries Act 1888) was passed to carry into
effect the terms of the convention. The act (now repealed and
replaced by the North Sea Fisheries Act 1893, with which it is
identical but for some slight verbal modifications) imposes a fine
not exceeding £50 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three
months for supplying, exchanging or otherwise selling spirits.
It imposes a like penalty for purchasing spirits by exchange or
otherwise, and requires every British vessel dealing in provisions
or other articles to have a licence and to carry a special mark.
In 1882 Mr E. J. Mather started a mission to deep sea fishermen,
which sends out mission ships and supplies the fishermen with
good clothing, literature, tobacco, &amp;c., at a fair price. This
mission, now the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen,
is registered by the Board of Trade.</p>

Dutch <i>kuip</i> and Eng. &ldquo;kipe&rdquo; and &ldquo;coop,&rdquo; but cooper is apparently

making casks, barrels and other rounded vessels, the sides of
which are composed of separate staves, held together by hoops
surrounding them. The art is one of great antiquity; Pliny ascribes
its invention to the inhabitants of the Alpine valleys. The trade
is one in which there are numerous subdivisions, the chief of
which are tight or wet and dry or slack cask manufacture.
To these may be added white cooperage, a department which
embraces the construction of wooden tubs, pails, churns and other
even-staved vessels. Of all departments, the manufacture of
tight casks or barrels for holding liquids is that which demands
the greatest care and skill since, in addition to being perfectly
tight when filled with liquid, the vessels must bear the strain of
transportation to great distances, and in many cases have to
resist considerable internal pressure when they contain fermenting
liquors. The staves are best made of well-seasoned oak.
Since a cask is a double conoid, usually having its greatest
diameter (technically the bulge or belly) at the centre, each
stave must be properly curved to form a segment of the whole,
and must be so cut as to have a suitable bilge or increase of
width from the ends to the middle; it must also have its edges
bevelled to such an angle that it will form tight joints with its
neighbours. The staves being prepared, the next operation is to
set up or raise the barrel. For this purpose as many staves as are
necessary are arranged upright in a circular frame, and round
their lower halves are fitted truss hoops which serve to keep
them together for the permanent hooping. The upper ends are
then drawn together by means of a rope which is passed round
them and tightened by a windlass, and other truss hoops are
dropped over them, the wood being steamed or heated to enable
it to bend freely to shape. The two ends of the cask are next
finished to receive the heads by forming the chime, or bevel on
the extremity of the staves, and the croze or groove into which
the heads fit. Finally the heads and permanent hoops are put in
place. The heads, when made of two or more pieces, are jointed
by wooden dowel pins, and after being cut to size are chamfered
or bevelled round the edge to fit into the croze grooves. The
hoops are generally of iron. The manufacture of slack casks
proceeds on the same general lines, but is simpler in various
respects, both because less accurate workmanship is required, and
because softer woods, largely fir, may be employed. Machinery of
the most elaborate and specialized character has been devised to
perform most of the operations in making both slack and tight
casks, and though it involves considerable capital outlay it
effects so great an economy of time that it has largely superseded
hand labour. (For an account of such machinery see L. H. Ransome,
&ldquo;Cask-making Machinery,&rdquo; <i>Proc. Inst. Civ. Eng.</i> vol. 115;
also an article in <i>Engineering</i>, 1908, 85, p. 845.) Barrels without
separate staves are made by bending a sheet of wood, sawn from
a log in a continuous strip, into the required circular shape, the
bulge at the centre being obtained by cutting out V gores from
the ends. Barrels are also sometimes made of steel, either of the
ordinary bulging form or consisting of straight-sided drums
provided near the middle with rings on which they may be rolled.
Immense numbers of casks of different shapes and sizes are
employed in various industries. Tight barrels are a necessity to
the wine and cider maker, brewer and distiller, and are largely
used for the transport of oils and liquid chemicals, while slack
barrels are utilized by the million for packing cement, alkali,
china, fruit, fish and numerous other products.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CO-OPERATION<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span>, a term used particularly both for a theory
of life, and for a system of business, with the general sense
of &ldquo;working together&rdquo; (<i>con</i>, with, and <i>opus</i>, work). In its
narrowest usage it means a combination of individuals to economize
by buying in common, or increase their profits by selling in
common. In its widest usage it means the creed that life may
best be ordered not by the competition of individuals, where each
seeks the interest of himself and his family, but by mutual help;
by each individual consciously striving for the good of the social
body of which he forms part, and the social body in return
caring for each individual: &ldquo;each for all, and all for each&rdquo; is its
accepted motto. Thus it proposes to replace among rational and
moral beings the struggle for existence by voluntary combination
for life. More or less imperfectly embodying this theory, we have
co-operation in the concrete, or &ldquo;the co-operative movement,&rdquo;
meaning those forms of voluntary association where individuals
unite for mutual aid in the production of wealth, which they will
devote to common purposes, or share among them upon principles
of equity, reason and the common good, agreed upon beforehand.
Not that a co-operative society can begin by saying absolutely
what those principles in their purity would dictate. It begins
with current prices, current rates of wages and interest, current
hours of labour, and modifies them as soon as it can wherever
they seem least conformable to equity, reason and the common
good.</p>

<p>In the industrial world there is everywhere much working
together for the production of wealth, but this is not included in
co-operation if the shares of those concerned are determined by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
competition, <i>i.e.</i> by a struggle and the relative ability of each to
secure a large share. Nor do co-operators regard the association
as truly voluntary, though it may depend on contract, if that
contract be one of service only, without an opportunity for all
concerned to share in the ultimate control. Co-operation in
fact is essentially a democratic association. On the other hand,
there is some working together for the production of wealth
which without being competitive, or based on service, is not
strictly voluntary: thus in primitive societies there is much
customary help, combined with customary division of the produce;
and in advanced societies we have state and municipal socialism.
These are indeed sometimes included in co-operation, but at
least they are not voluntary co-operation, since the individual
has no choice but to take part in them; they depend on the
power of the ruler to coerce the ruled, or of the majority to
coerce the minority. In co-operation, meaning voluntary co-operation,
there may also, it is true, be frequent overruling of
the minority by the majority, but only so far as the minority
have, when joining the association, voluntarily agreed to permit,
and subject always to an effective ultimate right of secession.</p>

<p>Thus co-operation occupies the middle ground between
competition and state or municipal socialism. In its technical
sense, however, it does not cover the whole of this ground: it
does not cover associations which are primarily for social,
provident, or religious purposes, but only those closely connected
with the production of wealth. We speak of co-operative
societies for agriculture, for manufacturing, for retail, or wholesale
distribution, for building or house-owning, for raising capital
and so forth; while the great Friendly Societies (<i>q.v.</i>), though a
part of co-operation as a theory of life, are not part of the co-operative
movement. The line is somewhat hard to draw, and
consequently is drawn somewhat arbitrarily. Thus while a
society for building, or for the collective ownership of houses, is
counted a co-operative society, a Building Society (as we
ordinarily understand the term), though it be purely mutual in
its basis, is not so counted in Great Britain, but is in the United
States (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Building Societies</a></span>).</p>

<p>For the early history of the co-operative movement we have to
look chiefly to Great Britain, and British co-operation acknowledges
as its founder Robert Owen (<i>q.v.</i>). In every age
and every country the origins of co-operation may no
<span class="sidenote">Robert Owen.</span>
doubt be traced, where men have helped one another in
the creation of wealth and agreed as brothers as to its division.
In England long before the days of Owen there was much co-operation
of miners and fishermen which, though scarcely
obligatory on the individuals taking part in it, was largely
regulated by custom. Coming to more purely voluntary associations,
co-operative workshops are recorded, retail co-operation was
practised in Scotland from the middle of the 18th century, while
in England shops not unlike co-operative stores, but without the
democratic element, were in one or two instances set up by
benevolent individuals. It does not seem, however, that there
was any theory of co-operation until Owen in England, and
almost simultaneously Fourier (<i>q.v.</i>) in France, formulated their
gospels, not identical, yet having much in common. Of these
two Owen and his teaching are by far the more important.</p>

<p>The end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries
were the culminating days of the industrial revolution, when the
old organization of domestic industry had given way before the
factory system, and the population of the factory districts was
suffering a martyrdom, with ruin of body and degradation of
character, from unbridled competition, long hours, women&rsquo;s
and children&rsquo;s labour, pauper apprenticeship, great fluctuations
of trade and employment, dearness and adulteration of provisions,
the truck system and insanitary homes. Owen, having
himself become a great employer of labour, after starting as a
draper&rsquo;s assistant, saw that this was in every sense waste, and
that as it paid the manufacturer to have the best machinery and
not to overdrive it, but to tend it well and keep it in the best
repair, so it would pay him, and abundantly pay the nation,
to have the human machines well cared for, not overworked,
and kept in the best condition. The popular individualistic
philosophy of that day taught that the good of society would be
achieved by each individual seeking in his business relations
the interest of himself and his family; but Owen maintained
that the well-being of the social body could only be served if
each individual made that his conscious aim. For this reason he
and his disciples were called Socialists. He taught further that a
man&rsquo;s character depended mainly upon the circumstances which
influenced his life; he emphasized environment, and all but
denied heredity. At New Lanark, from 1799, he carried out
these ideas among the workers in the cotton mills of which he
was managing partner.<a name="FnAnchor_1e" id="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> &ldquo;For twenty-nine years,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;we did without the necessity for magistrates or lawyers;
without a single legal punishment; without any known poors&rsquo;
rate; without intemperance or religious animosities. We reduced
the hours of labour, well educated all the children from
infancy, greatly improved the condition of the adults, diminished
their daily labour, paid interest on capital, and cleared upwards
of £300,000 of profit.&rdquo; So wonderful were the results upon the
population, that New Lanark became a show-place of world-wide
renown, and was visited by many of the greatest and most
exalted people of the period.</p>

<p>While thus using his own power Owen not only advocated
legislation to limit the hours of factory labour, but appealed to
the public authorities to establish industrial communities, where
the poor might be set to work, and be managed paternally on
the principles of New Lanark. So great was his repute, and so
influential the royal and other personages who gave him their
support, that this appeal might probably have been successful
had not Owen, in reply to complaints as to his religious views&mdash;which
were deistic&mdash;and that his system was not founded on
religion, made a public attack upon all accepted religions.</p>

<p>Failing to get the required support from the Government and
magistrates, he still sought it from wealthy believers in his
teaching, and a number of &ldquo;communities&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Communism</a></span>)
were founded in England and Scotland, and in the United States.
These were intended to be self-supporting, the land and other
means of producing wealth being owned in common, and work
and education being regulated on Owen&rsquo;s principles. Owen well
knew that most of them lacked the large amount of capital
necessary, but his hand was forced by enthusiastic followers, and
even the most hopeful of the experiments, that of Queenwood in
Hampshire (1839-1844), was made prematurely and failed.</p>

<p>His connexion with New Lanark also came to an end, not from
any want of success, but through differences with some of his
partners who objected to such matters as dancing, military drill
for the children, and the wearing of kilts, but above all feared lest
Owen&rsquo;s &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; should undermine the people&rsquo;s faith.</p>

<p>Thus it might have seemed that Owen&rsquo;s life and fortune had
been spent in vain, and resulted only in unsuccessful experiments;
but this was far from being so. His teaching, and in particular
his doctrines of circumstance, and of the conscious seeking after
the social good, his belief in self-supporting communities, and his
vision of a new moral and industrial world, had powerfully
affected the working classes, indeed, all classes. Workmen in
many parts of the country had formed groups with the ultimate
object of founding self-supporting communities. If the government
and the rich would not provide capital enough to start
communities, the workers would start them themselves. Thus
was the democratic basis given to co-operation. As a means they
had been founding co-operative societies, which are sometimes
called &ldquo;union shops&rdquo; to distinguish them from the later growth
of societies of the Rochdale type. The members began by
buying provisions wholesale and retailing them to themselves at
current prices; the difference became capital, and as soon as
possible one member was set to work to make boots and another
clothes, and so forth, until ultimately the society should have
capital enough to take land and form a community. Education
also was prominent among their objects. These co-operative
societies reached some 400 or 500 between 1828 and 1834, but the
movement then collapsed. As the original enthusiasm died out,
or members left the neighbourhood, or capital accumulated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
the hands of the original shareholders, they almost all either failed
or became private property. In those early days, moreover, the
law gave no protection to the property of co-operative societies.
This remained so until 1852, when the Christian Socialists (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Socialism</a></span>) among their many great services to the working
classes secured such protection. In 1862 they secured also limited
liability for the members.</p>

<p>Before 1844 a co-operative society had already been formed and
failed at Rochdale in Lancashire, yet some ardent spirits planned
to form another. Twenty-eight poor men, flannel
weavers and such like, got together a capital of £28
<span class="sidenote">Rochdale pioneers.</span>
by twopenny and threepenny subscriptions, and in
December 1844 opened in Toad Lane, Rochdale, a little shop from
which, speaking broadly, the whole of British co-operation, and
very much of that of other lands, has grown. Their objects were
those of other co-operative societies of the time, including the
ultimate aim of a self-supporting community. In this last they
never succeeded, nor indeed did they attempt it; but they did
succeed in vastly improving the position of millions of the working
classes by enabling them to obtain their provisions cheap and
pure, to avoid the millstone of debt, to save money, to pass from
retail to wholesale trade, and from distribution to manufacturing,
building and house-owning, ship-owning and banking; above
all to educate themselves, and to live with an ideal.</p>

<p>The Rochdale Equitable Pioneers began their trading in the
smallest way, the members taking turns to serve in the shop;
yet where so many other Union shops had failed Rochdale
succeeded, and it has steadily grown to an institution with some
14,000 members, doing a trade of £300,000, owning shops and
workshops, a library and reading-rooms, making large profits, and
devoting a substantial part of them to education and to charitable
purposes. What was the reason of this difference? Chiefly it
would seem a different method of dealing with the profits.
Earlier &ldquo;Stores&rdquo; had divided these according to the capital
contributed by each member, or else equally among the members:
the Rochdale Pioneers determined that, after paying 5% interest
on the share capital, all profit should be allotted to the purchasing
members in proportion to their purchases, and be capitalized in
the name of the member entitled, until his shares amounted to
£5. Thus each member found it his interest to purchase at the
store and to introduce new purchasers. The ownership of the
store remained always with the purchasers, and each came under
the magic influence of a little capital saved.</p>

<p>Not only did Rochdale store grow amazingly, but its example
spread far and near. New stores were founded on the &ldquo;Rochdale
plan&rdquo; and old stores adopted it; soon they were
numbered by hundreds. In spite of many failures
<span class="sidenote">Growth of co-operative stores.</span>
there were in 1906 more than fourteen hundred such
stores in the United Kingdom, with nearly two and a
quarter million members, over £33,000,000 capital, and sales
exceeding £63,000,000 in the year. The number of societies does
not increase of late years, the tendency being rather for established
societies to open branches, but all the other figures increase
rapidly from year to year.</p>

<p>These workmen&rsquo;s Co-operative Stores, or Distributive Societies,
flourish chiefly in the north and midlands of England and in
Scotland, but are found more or less all over the country.
They, and practically all other British co-operative societies,
are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act,
which constitutes them corporate bodies, with limited liability,
and fixes £200 as the maximum that any member may hold in the
share capital. Their government is democratic, based on one
vote each, for man or woman; and their members or shareholders,
and their committee-men or directors, are almost
exclusively the more provident of the working classes, or belong
to the class just above. Store societies are of various sizes, from
the small village shop to the greatest of them all, the Leeds
Society, with nearly 30,000 members, sales exceeding a million
and a half sterling, and an elaborate organization of branches
and manufacturing departments. Their method, the &ldquo;Rochdale
system,&rdquo; is as follows, subject to occasional variations. Membership
is open to all who pay a shilling entrance fee and sign for a
£1 share, which can be paid up out of profit. For the most part
members may at any time withdraw their shares in cash at par.
A record of each member&rsquo;s purchases is kept by means of metal
tokens or otherwise, and at the end of each quarter, after paying a
limited interest (never more than 5%, and in very many societies
less) on shares, and, in some societies, paying a proportion of
profit to the employees, the surplus is divided to the members in
proportion to their purchases: non-members also usually receiving
half dividends on theirs. Thus the members in effect obtain their
necessaries at cost price. The dividend on members&rsquo; purchases
averages about 2s. 6d. in the £. In many successful societies even
more is paid, but the average is falling. Where dividend is high,
prices are often fixed above those current in the neighbourhood,
so that the members, in addition to saving the retailer&rsquo;s profit,
use their Society as a sort of savings bank, where they put away
a halfpenny or so for every shilling they spend. In addition to
retailing, a store often manufactures bread, clothes, boots and
millinery, sometimes farms land, or grinds corn; usually for its
own members only, but occasionally for sale to other societies
also. Their productions in this way exceed £5,000,000 a year.
They also invest large and increasing sums in building cottages, to
let or sell to their members; and they lend still more largely to
their members, to enable them to buy cottages.</p>

<p>Outwardly these stores may look like mere shops, but they are
really much more. First, they are managed with a view not to a
proprietor&rsquo;s profit, but to cheap and good commodities. Secondly
they have done an immense work for thrift and the material
prosperity of the working classes, and as teachers of business
and self-government. But further, they have a distinct social
and economic aim, namely, to correct the present inequalities of
wealth, and substitute for the competitive system an industry
controlled by all in the common interest, and distributing on
principles of equity and reason, mutually agreed on, the wealth
produced. With this view they acknowledge the duties of fair
pay and good conditions for their own employees, and of not
buying goods made under bad conditions. The best societies
further set aside a small proportion of their profits for educational
purposes, including concerts, social gatherings, classes, lectures,
reading-rooms and libraries, and often make grants to causes with
which they sympathize. Their members are prominent in local
government affairs; co-operative candidates are occasionally run
for town councils, and often talked of for parliament. Though
the societies are non-political, and have refused to join the labour
representation movement, they are usually centres of &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;
ideas. There are of course many defects, and of their
two million members a large, and many fear an increasing,
proportion, attracted by the prosperity of the societies, think
chiefly of what they themselves gain; but the government of the
movement has, hitherto at least, been largely in the hands of men
of ideas, who believe that stores are but a step to co-operative
production, and on to the &ldquo;co-operative commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is indeed only when we come to federations of co-operative
societies, and above all to production, with its large number of
employees, that the educational side of the movement and its
power to promote industrial reform are most seen. The Co-operative
Union, Limited, for instance, is a propagandist
federation of all the chief co-operative societies in Great Britain,
and some in Ireland. Its income of £10,000 a year is contributed
by the Co-operative Societies. It looks after their legal and
parliamentary interests, carries on much educational work by
means of literature, lectures, classes, scholarships, summer
meetings at the universities, and so on; organizes numerous
local conferences for discussion, and once a year a great national
co-operative congress, and exhibition of productions, in some
chief centre of population. The Co-operative Wholesale Society,
Limited, is a trading federation of the great majority of the
English stores. Founded in 1863 on a small scale, it now counts
its employees by thousands, its capital by millions, and its yearly
sales by tens of millions. Besides its merchant trade, it manufactures
to the value of £4,500,000, owning factories, warehouses
and land in many districts. It imports largely, and runs its own
steamships. It is also the bank of the co-operative societies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
and the chief outlet for the always redundant capital of the well-established
stores. The Scottish stores also have their Wholesale
Society, not less important relatively. For many purposes these
two are in partnership. In each of them the net profits are
returned to the stores as a dividend on purchases, and thence to
the whole body of members; but in the Scottish Wholesale a part
is also paid to its employees as a dividend upon their wages.
There are also a few local federations of stores, mostly for corn-milling
and baking.</p>

<p>Strongly contrasting with this production by associations of
consumers, or &ldquo;consumers&rsquo; production,&rdquo; is the co-partnership, or
labour co-partnership, branch of co-operation. Its
simplest form is an association of producers formed to
<span class="sidenote">Co-partnership.</span>
carry on their own industry. Originally such societies
were intended to consist solely of the workers employed; the
ideal was the &ldquo;self-governing workshop,&rdquo; introduced from France
by the Christian Socialists of 1850; but membership is now open
to the distributive societies, which are the chief customers, and
usually, to all sympathizers. Shares are transferable, not
withdrawable. Profits first pay the agreed &ldquo;wages of capital,&rdquo;
usually 5%, and of what remains the main part goes to the
employees as a dividend on their wages, and to the customers as a
dividend on their purchases. In well-established societies the
dividend on wages averages about 1s. on the £. This is not
usually paid in cash, but credited to the employees as share
capital, whereby all may become members. Besides other
producers&rsquo; associations, more or less co-operative, there are over
a hundred co-partnership societies at work in England, against a
dozen or fifteen in 1883. They are engaged in boot-making,
printing, building, weaving, clothing, wood-working, metal-working,
and so on. Some of them are very small, while others
have businesses of £50,000 a year or more, the average being
about £10,000. The majority show fair, sometimes large
profits. Each is governed by a committee, which is elected by
the members and appoints the manager. A minority of them
sell in the open, <i>i.e.</i> the non-co-operative, market, and a few sell
largely for export.</p>

<p>We constantly hear that co-operative production is a failure.
There have no doubt been failures, especially of big experiments
attempted among men totally unprepared. But many
of the failures counted were not truly co-operative.
<span class="sidenote">Rival theories.</span>
At the present day consumers&rsquo; production is successful
beyond all question, while the net growth of producers&rsquo; associations
in the last twenty years has been marked both in number
and importance. These two forms of production best illustrate
the two rival theories which divide British co-operation, and
between whose partisans the conflict has at times been sharp.
The consumers&rsquo; theory maintains that all profit on price is
abstracted from the consumer, and must be returned to him;
while to him should also belong all capital and control, subject to
such regulations as the state and the trade unions enforce.
This theory is fully exemplified in the English Wholesale Society,
and in some of the smaller federations for production, which
employ workmen, whether co-operators or not, for wages only,
and admit no individual, but only co-operative societies, to
membership. It is also exemplified by the great majority of the
stores, though in their case the employee may become a member
in his capacity as a consumer. The co-partnership theory, on
the other hand, maintains that the workers actually employed in
any industry, whether distributive or productive, should be
partners with those who find the capital, and those who buy the
produce, and should share with them the profit, responsibilities
and control. The consumers&rsquo; party contend that societies of
producers make a profit out of the consumers, and thus are never
truly co-operative, while as they multiply they must compete
against each other. The co-partnership party answer that labour
at least helps to make the profit, and that competition, as yet
almost insignificant between their societies, can be avoided by
federating them (a process long ago begun) for buying and selling
in common, and for other common purposes, while leaving each
the control and responsibility of its own internal affairs. They
further advocate the eventual federation of the productive wing
of co-operation with the distributive, for settling prices and all
matters in which their interests might conflict. In this way they
say the co-operative system may extend indefinitely without
sacrificing either individual responsibility and freedom, or a
general unity and control, so far as these are necessary to secure
the common interest. On the other hand they hold that the
opposing system tends more and more to centralization and
bureaucracy, and divorces the individual workman from all
personal interest in his work, and from any control over its
conditions. They contend, moreover, and it is indeed admitted
that, in spite of the great advantages which consumers&rsquo; production
has in its command of a market and of abundant capital,
only a small part of industry can ever be carried on by associations
of the persons who actually consume the produce. Outside
this small part, therefore, voluntary co-operation is impossible
except as some form of co-partnership.</p>

<p>On the working-out of these two principles depends the future
of co-operation. The example of Scotland probably throws
light on the problem. There co-operative production, amounting
to some millions sterling, is nearly all carried on by federations of
consumers&rsquo; societies, including the Scottish Wholesale, which
apply more or less successfully the co-partnership principle&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
their employees are admitted to share in profits, and may
become members, whereby they are further admitted to share in
capital and control. The type of organization hence resulting is
very much the same as where a society of producers admits
consumers&rsquo; societies to membership, and sets aside a proportion of
the profits to be returned to them as dividend upon their
purchases. To this combined type, we have seen, English
productive societies, started by producers, have come; and it
would appear that those started by consumers must ultimately
tend to it. However, in spite of honoured leaders of the early
days, the consumers&rsquo; party is at present greatly in the ascendant
in English co-operation, and even in the Scottish federations it is
almost strong enough to abolish co-partnership, and allow no one
to share in capital, profit or control except in his capacity as a
consumer.</p>

<p>An association of co-operative societies and individuals, called
the Labour Co-partnership Association, exists to maintain the
principle of co-partnership in co-operation, and also to promote
its gradual adoption in ordinary businesses. Some progress in
this latter direction is being made, there being a tendency to
improve upon simple profit-sharing by capitalizing the workman&rsquo;s
&ldquo;bonus,&rdquo; whereby he becomes a shareholder, and the business
is gradually modified in a co-operative direction. There are
remarkable instances of such modification abroad, notably that
of the great iron foundry and <i>Familistère</i> at Guise in France.
The most noteworthy, among several, in England is that of the
South Metropolitan Gas Company, where after eighteen years of
the system 5000 odd employees had in 1907 more than £320,000
invested in the company; they also elect three of themselves
directors of the company, this being one-third of the board.
Unfortunately this example is, or at least was, marred by a feud
with the trade unions, whereas there is friendship between trade
unionism and co-partnership, as indeed between trade unionism
and co-operation generally.</p>

<p>One of the most recent and promising developments of English
co-operation is the tenants&rsquo; co-partnership movement for the
common ownership of groups of houses, which the
<span class="sidenote">Tenants&rsquo; co-partnership societies.</span>
society owning them lets out to its members. These
societies are but few as yet, but they have sprung up
rapidly and promise great usefulness and extension.
Somewhat similar societies have long been a recognized branch of
co-operation on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the history and present extent of co-operation
in Great Britain. Turning abroad we find in almost all civilized
countries, besides other forms of co-operation, important
and growing movements roughly similar to
<span class="sidenote">The movement outside Britain.</span>
those above described, but on the whole less identified
with the working classes and less coloured by their
social and economic ideals. In France, Germany, Switzerland,
Italy and elsewhere, there are very important co-operative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
distributive movements looking to Rochdale as their prototype;
and in the United States of America there are at least continual
attempts to spread Rochdale co-operation. Of these foreign
stores, however, many exhibit important modifications, such as
unlimited liability, and selling at cost price, or between that and
market prices. On the whole we may say that Rochdale Co-operation
is the most extended and the most typical. It, and the
workshop movement springing from Fourier, and the socialist co-operation
of Belgium and elsewhere, are certainly the forms which
have most of the ideal of democratic equality and social reconstruction.
Other forms look more to the money benefits accruing
to the members, seeking to supplement the present order of
society, rather than to bring in a new order. Among these other
forms&mdash;separate in origin, in methods, and largely in spirit&mdash;the
most important are credit co-operation, or people&rsquo;s banking, and
agricultural co-operation, two forms until recently unknown in
the British Islands.</p>

<p>Confusion has sometimes arisen from the fact that while
Rochdale Co-operation sets itself against &ldquo;credit,&rdquo; continental
co-operation is more concerned with obtaining credit
for its members than with anything else. But credit is
<span class="sidenote">Germany and credit co-operation.</span>
used in two senses. The English workman employed
for wages is against the credit which means spending
them before they are earned: continental co-operation seeks by
collective credit to put into the hands of working peasants,
craftsmen and traders, the stock and the tools without which
their labour is vain. Credit for consumption is the road to
poverty; credit for production the road to well-being.</p>

<p>Just as with co-operation in labour and in purchase, so mutual
help in obtaining credit may doubtless be traced in primitive
forms far back into history. It was certainly more or less &ldquo;in
the air&rdquo; in Germany and France about 1848 and even earlier;
but the beginning of systematic organized credit co-operation
may be definitely fixed in the year 1849, when Raiffeisen began
his <i>Darlehnscasse</i>, or loan bank, in Rhenish Prussia. Curiously
enough it had also a second and entirely independent origin. For
in the following year Schulze-Delitzsch, in a distant part of the
same kingdom, established his Credit Society based on an
entirely different system. As this second system spread much
more rapidly than the other and attained, as indeed it retains,
much greater commercial magnitude, it came to be regarded as
the beginning of credit co-operation, of which for a long time it
was the only important form. These two remain the two distinct
types in every land. Thus Germany, which has innumerable
co-operative societies of every form and of great importance, is
in particular the mother of credit co-operation.</p>

<p>In the famine years of 1846 and 1847 and for some years after,
Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen was a burgomaster in the barren
Westerwald. The people were hopelessly ground down
by debt to money-lenders for small doles of capital,
<span class="sidenote">Raiffeisen loan banks.</span>
advanced to purchase stock, or meet times of special
difficulty. It occurred to Raiffeisen that by combining
to borrow a moderate sum of money on their joint responsibility,
and afterwards to lend it out among themselves in small sums at a
slightly greater rate of interest, the peasants might obtain relief
from their burden of usury, and at the same time get the capital
necessary to make their labour productive. Accordingly in 1849
at the little town of Flammersfeld, he set up a &ldquo;Loan Bank.&rdquo;
Despite its success, it remained the only one of its kind for five
years, when Raiffeisen founded a second. There was no third
for eight years more: it was only in 1880 that they began really
to spread, but now they are found in many lands and are counted
by thousands.</p>

<p>Such a bank is essentially an association of neighbours.
Besides borrowing, it also receives savings deposits, which often
produce a large part of, or even all, the capital it needs. Usually
a few of the members are comparatively well to do people, who
join to help their neighbours by increasing the society&rsquo;s credit.
This Raiffeisen considered essential. They have no actual privilege,
but by common consent they take a leading part. In the
true Raiffeisen bank the liability of each member is unlimited,
but limited liability has been introduced in some of its modifications.
The Society confines its operations strictly to a small area,
say a parish, where everyone knows everyone. Each borrower
must specify the purpose for which he wants a loan, say to buy a
cow or drain a field, or pay off a money-lender, and this is
rigorously inquired into. Only members can borrow. Any
member, however poor, can borrow for a profitable approved
purpose, and no one, however rich, for any other. Practically
all the members see that the money is applied as agreed; and,
while the loan is often made for a long period, a year or two&mdash;even
for ten or more&mdash;so as to repay itself out of the
profit, power is reserved to call it in at short notice if misapplied.
Loans are repayable by periodical instalments, but repayments
must be made with absolute punctuality. No bills, mortgages or
other securities are taken, except a note of hand either alone or
with one or two sureties. There are two committees, one to lend
and do the work of the society, and the other to supervise the
first; and on both of these it is understood that the richer
members are to be in a majority. No committeeman or officer
receives any remuneration for his services, except that the
accountant gets a small salary. Originally there were no shares,
and when in 1889 the legislature ordained that there must be
shares, the Raiffeisen banks made theirs as small as possible,
generally ten or twelve shillings. Nothing is paid on the shares as
interest or dividend, all profit being voted once for all to the
ordinary reserve and the indivisible reserve, the latter the
backbone of the system. In every large district the Raiffeisen
banks are federated in a Union, and these Unions culminate in a
General Agency. As an intermediary among themselves, and
between them and the money market, the banks have also a
central bank with a capital of £500,000, and with ten provincial
branches. A great deal of agricultural co-operation has arisen
from these banks as centres, and with the money they have
supplied.</p>

<p>Raiffeisen banks boast that neither member nor creditor has
ever lost a penny by them, and while this is denied it seems at
least near the truth. Their credit is so good that they can obtain
money at very low rates, and as their expenses are trifling they
can re-lend to their members at rates but little higher. In
Germany they usually lend at about 5%. Only men of good
character can obtain membership: thus, besides spreading
prosperity, they have everywhere been great promoters of
sobriety and good conduct. They were only intended to meet
the needs of the peasants, especially of the very poorest, and for
this purpose they have proved admirably suited.</p>

<p>Very different were the people among whom Schulze-Delitzsch
established his form of co-operative credit; and very different
the organization he adopted and the results which have
flowed from it. In 1850 Franz Hermann Schulze was a
<span class="sidenote">Schulze-Delitzch banks.</span>
judge in his native town of Delitzsch, almost at the
middle point of the southern edge of Prussia, and
established there his first <i>Vorschussverein</i>, or Advance-Union.
He had been in England and knew something of our co-operative
movement, but he scarcely seems to have derived any part of his
inspiration from it. The people he desired to help were townsmen,
especially the small craftsmen working on their own account,
the joiners, shoemakers and so forth; and his ideal was to do this
merely by stimulating their thrift.</p>

<p>In a Schulze-Delitzsch bank, a number of such men combine
together to raise a capital of guarantee: to do this every member
takes up one share and one only, which is of large value, say
£30 or £50 or even much more, but can be paid up by small
instalments. Thus every member is committed to a long course
of saving. On the strength of this capital in course of formation,
and the unlimited liability of the members, the bank is able to
borrow, or to receive as savings and deposits from members and
others, a much larger capital. The funds so constituted it lends
out at the highest rates it can command, originally 12% or 14%,
but now very much less, and varying, of course, with the market.
It lends to members only, but to any amount, for any purpose and
on any good and sufficient security, whether acceptance, promissory
note, overdraft, discount, mortgage, pledge, surety or
what not. The loans, however, are always for a short period,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
usually three months, renewable for another three months, and
sometimes further than that. The committee of management are
elected by the general meetings; they decide on all loans, and
receive a salary, plus a commission on the business done. The
council of supervision are also paid, or at least entitled to pay.
The great objects which a bank keeps in view are security and a
good return on capital. It is not confined to a small area, but
works for as large and as varied a constituency as possible. With
such a constitution the Schulze-Delitzsch banks grow big and
accumulate a large capital of their own. On an average each
bank has nearly 600 members and lends about £150,000 per
annum, including loans renewed. Losses are sometimes made,
but they are not heavy on the whole. All the profits are divided
upon capital, or put to reserve, except some, usually small,
sums given to charitable or educational purposes. Dividends
average about 5%, but have been known to reach and even
exceed 30%.</p>

<p>It may therefore justly be said that for co-operative institutions
these banks smack too much of joint-stockism: they are in
fact co-operative not much more than in the same sense that the
Oldham cotton mills, and other &ldquo;working-class limiteds,&rdquo; have
sometimes been loosely called co-operative. They seem constituted
to make the lender&rsquo;s interest supreme, but they have,
nevertheless, conferred enormous benefits on the handicraftsmen,
small traders, small cultivators and others who borrow from
them. They have put capital within their reach at reasonable
rates.</p>

<p>These banks also have their central point. In 1864 the German
Co-operative Societies&rsquo; Bank was founded to centralize the work
of the local Schulze-Delitzsch banks and to bring the money
market within their reach. It was not itself co-operative, and
never confined its business to the co-operative banks. Beginning
in a very small way, by 1903 it had attained a capital of a million
and a half sterling and a yearly business of £154,000,000, of
which £28,000,000 was specifically with co-operative credit
societies. It was then amalgamated with another banking
business, the <i>Dresdner Bank</i>, esteemed one of the most important
and successful in Germany.</p>

<p>Thus these two types of credit co-operation agree in being
founded on unlimited liability, but speaking broadly they are
contrasted in that the Schulze-Delitzsch banks work primarily,
though by no means solely, among townsmen, are based on share
capital, work for profit, which they divide on shares, are conducted
by paid directors, and confer their benefits not on the
very poorest but rather, as their own friends say, on the middle
classes: the Raiffeisen banks are designed for the peasantry, are
not based upon share capital, neither divide, nor work for,
profit, are conducted by unpaid directors, and confer their
benefits especially on the very poor. The Schulze-Delitzsch type
is strong in self-help, but tends to commercialism as it grows;
the other needs the help of the well-to-do to back up the self-help
of the poor, but it tends to altruism and the union of
classes.</p>

<p>The world has 30,000 co-operative credit societies, not counting
building societies; and though they are organized in many
groups, especially in their native Germany, for local reasons, or
because of some modification, or some compromise between the
two systems, the two types really include them all. There is,
however, a strong tendency to introduce limited liability into
various offshoots of the one type and the other; even into the
orthodox Schulze-Delitzsch banks themselves, when they grow
big. From Germany co-operative banks have spread into almost
all European countries&mdash;even at last to Ireland and England&mdash;and
to America and Asia. In Germany there are some fifteen
thousand local, and no less than sixty central, co-operative
credit associations, which lend out £180,000,000 a year including
renewals. In Italy, Austria and Hungary they are also strong.
In 1896 it was estimated that £150,000,000 a year must be very
well within the total amount lent by money co-operation on the
continent of Europe; eight years later it could not well fall short
of £250,000,000, and the amount keeps constantly increasing.
Of this total only a small percentage represents loans by banks of
the Raiffeisen type, which, though very numerous, often lend
only a few hundred pounds each in the year.</p>

<p>Great controversy has prevailed as to the state subsidies given
to co-operative credit. While governments are sometimes rather
inclined to hinder co-operative distribution, they have shown
a marked tendency to foster, whether for political or economic
reasons, co-operative credit. The Prussian government in
response to popular demand, vigorously supported by the
agricultural interest, has founded and endowed with £2,500,000
of public money, the Central Co-operative Bank, whose object
is to bring capital within the reach of the various groups of co-operative
banks. The Schulze-Delitzsch Union was the only
one to dispute the need of this, and though the bank has given
a stimulus to the formation of co-operative societies, it still
denies that this is a healthy propagation. Nevertheless, some
even of the Schulze-Delitzsch societies resort to this state bank
for money. It is under government administration and lends
immense sums each year. In France the Bank of France has
been compelled to lend £1,600,000 free of interest, and to give
about £120,000 per annum out of its profits to assist agriculture;
this money is being lent free to &ldquo;regional&rdquo; banks, and by them
at about 3% to local societies. State help has also been given
to the co-operative bank of the French workmen&rsquo;s productive
societies. In Austria and in many other countries a great deal
of similar help has been given.</p>

<p>Closely connected with certain developments of credit, and
deserving to rank as the third, if not the second, great subdivision
of co-operation, is agricultural co-operation,
a movement in the main of the last twenty years, but
<span class="sidenote">Denmark and agricultural co-operation.</span>
amounting now to a great force, almost everywhere
except in Great Britain, and in some countries almost
to a revolution. It is important to say agricultural
co-operation and not co-operative agriculture, for in spite of
some customary mutual help in farm work, in spite of several
attempts, and some small successes, in co-operative farming,
the actual cultivation is almost everywhere individualistic.
The farmer or peasant cultivates alone, or with his family, or
servants; when he co-operates with his fellows, it is to manufacture,
or to market, the products of his farm, or more often
to obtain the things he needs for his farming, to raise stock, to
own expensive machinery in common, or insure against risks.
By these means the small farmer, without sacrificing his own
peculiar advantages, obtains most of the advantages of the big
farmer, to the immense improvement of his position.</p>

<p>At almost every point agricultural and credit co-operation
touch; yet the most perfect example of agricultural co-operation
is not concerned with credit co-operation in any form. The
farmers of Denmark practise co-operation in almost every
variety, except for raising capital. The commercial banks have
provided money to start dairies and other co-operative societies;
so that, it would appear, the need of credit co-operation has not
been felt.</p>

<p>The Danish farmer is almost always a freeholder: it is little
more than a century since his ancestors were serfs. It is little
more than a generation since a few men, turning to account the
strong national feeling aroused by the defeat of 1864, started a
great educational movement which has left its mark on all strata
of Danish society. After the People&rsquo;s High School, technical
schools arose in various places; and to these, and to the excellent
continuation schools in the country districts, the Danes are
beholden for the regeneration of their agriculture. From 1867
co-operative distributive societies on the Rochdale plan had been
spreading in Denmark; but it was not till 1882 that co-operation
in agriculture began, and the first co-operative dairy was formed;
ten years later there were about a thousand such, a number
which has slightly increased since. These dairies are productive
societies in which the cow-owners are the shareholders, and all
shareholders have equal rights and equal voting power, whether
they own one cow or one hundred. Almost every village has
its co-operative dairy, fitted to deal with the milk of from 400
to 1400, or even 2000 cows. They far exceed all the other dairies
of Denmark. More than four-fifths of all the milk of Denmark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
is used in them, and they produce butter worth more than nine
millions sterling. The profits are divided among those who supply
the cream, in proportion to the value of their supplies&mdash;a method
of dividing profits characteristic of agricultural co-operation.
The village dairies are united in federations to export their
produce.</p>

<p>Side by side with the dairies are other co-operative societies,
quite independent but largely composed of the same members,
for buying collectively fodder, manures and other agricultural
or household requisites, for collecting and exporting eggs,
slaughtering hogs and curing bacon, improving the breed of
stock, for bee-keeping, fruit-growing and so forth. By means
of these societies the country has been greatly enriched. The
farmer not uncommonly belongs to ten co-operative societies,
besides probably a farmers&rsquo; club. The work of starting and
administrating the societies is seldom paid, and many farmers
give much time to it gratuitously. They are in the main
organized on the same principles as the dairies, but with variations;
the largest egg export society, for instance, has over
30,000 members. It is not a federation of village societies, but
a centralized body with many branches.</p>

<p>The growth of the bacon-curing societies has been remarkable.
The first of them was not founded until 1887, but they spread
rapidly, and in seven years there were twenty, killing more than
half the country&rsquo;s then produce of hogs. The movement has
greatly increased since then, and multiplied its output about
fourfold. Co-operation in collecting, grading and exporting
eggs only began in 1895, and in eight years 65,000 members
had joined the various egg societies, and the value of eggs
exported had reached £436,000. Taken as a whole, the effect of
agricultural co-operation in Denmark has amounted to little less
than a revolution. It has brought the results of science within the
peasant&rsquo;s reach, and he has been quick to avail himself of them:
it has transformed a great part of farm work into a factory
industry, increased the yield of the soil, improved the material
position of the peasants, and drawn rich and poor together.
Denmark, once so poor, is now, except England, probably the
richest country in Europe in proportion to its population.
Besides Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland,
Finland, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada,
Ireland and many other countries have important developments
of agricultural co-operation. In Germany, where it is closely
connected with credit co-operation, it seems to date from 1866
only, yet in forty years agricultural co-operative societies have
come to number six thousand, without counting the agricultural
banks, which exceed twice that number. There are dairies,
societies to purchase farm requisites, societies of grape-growers,
hop-growers and beetroot-growers, distilleries, labour societies,
insurance societies, societies to own warehouses and granaries
and to sell produce, to purchase land and resell it in small
holdings, and even several societies which purchase land to
cultivate it in common. The close connexion between credit-societies
and other agricultural co-operation is exemplified in
the Central Union of orthodox Raiffeisen credit societies at
Neuwied. Through a central bank and a trading department
allied to it, it has negotiated the joint purchase of coal, feeding-stuffs,
manures, machinery and so forth to large amounts, as well
as the difficult business of the combined sale of agricultural
produce. Moreover, several local centres connected with this
union have granaries and warehouses for the storage of agricultural
produce, and negotiate joint sales, while within the union
facilities have been found for selling the products of one district
to members in another.</p>

<p>In Ireland stores have not hitherto flourished, though a few
exist. Irish co-operation is agricultural, and dates from the
foundation of one co-operative dairy in 1889. Thence
has grown a movement already of great importance,
<span class="sidenote">Irish agriculture.</span>
still advancing and comprising from eighty to ninety
thousand members, belonging to some hundreds of
societies&mdash;dairies, agricultural supply societies, banks and so
forth, formed on the Danish model. To form a dairy the small
working farmers of a district register a society and take up
shares of £1 each, in proportion to the number of their cows.
Each brings his milk to be separated, is paid for the butter-making
material it contains, and receives back skim milk. If
any profit is divided, it belongs nine-tenths to the suppliers of
milk in proportion to the value of their supplies, and one-tenth
to the dairy employees as dividend on wages in pursuance of
the co-partnership principle. These dairies produce butter
worth more than £1,000,000. Their rapid spread is due to their
great influence in improving the quality of butter, and hence
increasing the farmer&rsquo;s gains. The co-operative banks are of
the Raiffeisen type, though a few have limited liability. They
aim at providing the peasants with necessary capital (&ldquo;the
lucky money&rdquo; they have christened it) and expelling the usurer.
They are increasing rapidly. Among other objects of Irish
co-operation are selling eggs, poultry, barley and pigs, joint-grazing,
potato-spraying, scutching flax, bacon curing, home
industries, and of course supplying farm requisites. The movement
promises much further growth in magnitude and variety.
The dairy societies have federated into an agency for reaching
the English market, and the supply societies into an Irish
Wholesale for purchasing to the best advantage. Besides the
direct profits and economies of these societies, they have greatly
benefited Ireland by teaching men of all classes, parties and
religions to act together for peaceful progress; they have led
to a wide diffusion of better agricultural knowledge, and to the
establishment by government of the Agricultural Department.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ireland</a></span>.)</p>

<p>In France, which Englishmen are apt to speak of as preeminently
the country of co-operative production, the agricultural
is the most important branch of co-operation;
and the source and mainstay of agricultural co-operation
<span class="sidenote">Co-operative agriculture in France and other countries.</span>
are the <i>Syndicats Agricoles</i>. These are not
technically co-operative societies; they are rather
trade unions, not indeed of wage-earners only, or
mainly, but of cultivators. They cannot legally trade,
being constituted for the study and protection of the general
interests of the members, the spread of information, and so
forth. Their principal object however, seems in many cases
to be to combine their members for the purchase of all farm
requisites and especially of chemical manures. This they do
by collecting, sorting and passing on orders. They cannot
usually manage selling in common without the intervention of
a society specially registered for that object. Beginning only
in 1893, their number long ago ran into thousands and their
membership into hundreds of thousands, drawn from all classes
of cultivators and landowners, great and little. Among much
other good work they have led to the formation of a large
number of strictly co-operative societies for all the purposes
of agriculture, except cultivation in common. Thus there are
two thousand agricultural banks, besides butter factories,
distilleries, associations for threshing, for sale of fruit and
vegetables, for wine-making, oil-pressing, and so on, amounting
altogether to some hundreds. There are also societies, mostly
of ancient date, engaged in making Gruyère cheese: a few years
ago these numbered 2000, but they are dwindling. Lastly, there
are some eight thousand mutual insurance societies organized
as agricultural syndicates.</p>

<p>Everywhere the main features of this agricultural movement
are similar to those we have seen in Denmark and Ireland; it
is supplementary to individual cultivation; hardly ever does
it appear as associations for cultivating in common, and, speaking
with certain important exceptions, it has no very ideal aims,
but seeks chiefly to give the farmer a better profit. In England
there are a number of farms worked by stores, and several
large associations for the supply of farm requisites; but the
typical agricultural co-operation, based on small village societies
and federations of such societies, has only recently been made
known and begun to take root.</p>

<p>It is notable that while the <i>Syndicats agricoles</i> are almost
exactly what Fourier, the Robert Owen of France, foresaw as the
next stage of social development, the other great branch of
French co-operation, the workshop movement of the <i>Associations</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
<i>ouvrières de production</i>, is directly due to his teaching, which
<span class="sidenote">France and co-operative production.</span>
led in 1848 to the starting of a large number of co-operative
workshops. The suppression of association after the
advent of Napoleon III. killed most of them, but
with the return of liberty they revived and they have
steadily increased ever since. They vary somewhat
among themselves, but are in the main combinations of
workmen to carry on their industries with their own capital or
that of their trade unions. Their chief difference from English
co-partnership societies is that they very rarely admit to membership
any persons not belonging to the trade. They are engaged
in a great variety of industries, selling comparatively little to
co-operative distributive societies, as English co-partnership
societies do, but taking contracts from government departments
and the municipalities, and supplying the general public.
Complete statistics of their total trade are not available, but
it exceeds £2,000,000, and the separate societies seem to vary,
like the majority of English co-partnership societies, from about
£40,000 a year downwards, a few being larger but the great
majority small. From about 140 societies in 1896 they have
grown to between two and three times that number, and the
increase continues with rapidity. More than two hundred of
them are federated in the <i>Chambre consultative des associations
ouvières de production</i>, which looks after certain business interests
of the societies, and also assists the formation of new
ones by propaganda and advice. In Paris alone about a third of
these societies are found.</p>

<p>It has been objected that their growth is artificial inasmuch as
the government gives them certain advantages, such as preference
over the private contractor at an equal price, exemption
from the deposit of security, and special concessions as to
payments on account. It also grants a subvention (recently
about £7000 per annum), which was formerly all given to the
societies in grants, but is now largely lent to them at not more
than 2% interest through their own special bank. This bank
was founded in 1893 to help the societies with loans and discounts,
and was soon after endowed by a disciple of Fourier with £20,000.
The societies have also benefited by other private beneficence
and public help. As to the Government aid, it must be remembered
that in France the state helps all forms of industry
in ways unknown to us, and the French co-operative producers
always declare that what is done for them is a trifle compared
to what is done for other manufacturers. Moreover, they get
many large contracts in open and unaided competition. In
these societies the <i>auxiliaires</i>, or workers who are not members,
are often numerous; but no society is now admitted to their
federation which does not share profits with the <i>auxiliaires</i> and
facilitate their admission to membership.</p>

<p>Consumers&rsquo; co-operation, credit co-operation, agricultural
co-operation, and workshop co-operation, as exemplified in
Great Britain, Germany, Denmark and France, are found in
most advanced countries, some in one and some in another,
in forms roughly similar to those above described. Of co-operation
for production it might have been said, a few years ago,
that outside Great Britain it everywhere meant associations of
producers. Except bakeries, there was but little consumers&rsquo;
production; that, however, seems now to be spreading in foreign
countries also. The most important developments of co-operation
not yet described are the socialist co-operation of Belgium,
the co-operative building societies of the United States, the
labour societies of Italy and Russia, the co-operation of German
craftsmen to provide themselves with raw material, and the
letting out of railway construction to temporary co-operative
groups of workmen by the New Zealand and Victorian
governments.</p>

<p>In Belgium co-operation is mostly socialist in the towns and
Catholic in the country. In all the principal industrial centres
are very important co-operative bakeries and distributive
societies, owned by co-operative groups, numbering thousands
of workmen of every calling. These <i>Maisons du peuple</i> are
admitted to be well managed, even by those who dislike their
politics. The socialist party look upon them chiefly as a means
of organizing and educating the working classes for political
and economic emancipation, and of providing funds for political
warfare. Like the English stores, and allied societies, they are
based on the consumer, but unlike them they pay no interest on
share capital, though they do on deposits. A much larger part
of the profit than in England is devoted to propaganda and
common purposes, though a part is also paid to the consumers
individually in the form of checks exchangeable for bread or
other goods. The workers employed also receive a share of
profit as a dividend on their wages, and elect their representatives
on the committee of management. By means of
these societies the party has a press, buildings, and the funds to
fight elections and support members in parliament. In France,
where the store movement has been of an individualistic, and
often middle class, tendency, the socialists have lately imitated
the example of Belgium, and seem to be winning more success
than the older French stores.</p>

<p>In the United States there has long been much important
agricultural co-operation, and there have been many much-advertised
attempts to establish Rochdale co-operation, but there
have so often been failures and even dishonesties that co-operation
has had a bad odour in the country, and the developments
come and go with such rapidity that it is difficult to speak with
confidence of its stability. The branch of co-operation which
has been a great success in the United States consists of the great
co-operative building societies, but building societies are not
considered part of the co-operative movement in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Co-operation of all kinds is greatly developed in Italy, but
one form is specially notable. The <i>Società di lavoro</i> are co-operative
labour gangs of great importance. They are counted
by hundreds, and are found among navvies, builders, masons,
carriers, stevedores, agricultural labourers and other workmen,
and have carried out very great works in Italy and in foreign
countries. They have, for instance, drained lands in the Campagna
and made a railway in Greece. They differ from productive
societies markedly in that they have comparatively little
to do with capital or material, but contract mainly for labour.</p>

<p>The Slavonic races seem to have a special aptitude for grouping
together co-operatively: it is said that men meeting casually
on a journey will do so for the brief time they are together. In
countries like Servia we see this ancient, and more or less customary,
loose and unstable co-operation meeting the modern
contractual, permanent co-operation of banks and other
registered societies. So in Russia, where so large a part in the
national organization is played by the <i>Artel</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Russia</a></span>), which
may be a transitory co-operative group of workmen undertaking
a particular piece of work, <i>e.g.</i> to build a house, or a permanent
association like that of the bank porters combined together to
guarantee one another&rsquo;s honesty.</p>

<p>While English and some other forms of co-operation have
always repudiated state help, and probably rightly, so far as
their own work is concerned, the state in almost all
countries, and conspicuously in England, has in fact
<span class="sidenote">State help.</span>
helped to the extent of providing special legislation, and waiving
fees, so as to encourage the formation of co-operative societies.
A second form of state help is very noticeable in the modern
development of agriculture, as in Denmark, Canada, New Zealand,
Ireland and very many countries, where the state has played a
great part in performing or assisting functions which neither
voluntary association nor individual enterprise could well
perform alone; in providing technical education, expert advisers,
exhibitions and prizes; in distributing information in all forms;
in finding out markets, controlling railway rates, subsidizing
steamboats, and even grading, branding, warehousing and
freezing produce, and maintaining trade agents abroad. These
things have not been done for co-operative societies alone, but
for agriculture in general; but co-operation has chiefly benefited,
and much has been done expressly to encourage the formation
of associations of cultivators, and provincial and national
federations of such associations; and government departments
of agriculture are found acting through such bodies, and with
their advice and assistance. The third and most questionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
form of state help is by direct subventions, and we have seen
how much has been done in this way for credit co-operation and
particularly agricultural credit. Harm has undoubtedly been
done in certain cases by forcing co-operative societies, whether
from political motives or merely mistaken policy. Yet even
as to money subventions, good authorities, while admitting the
great dangers, remain convinced that the advantages overbalance
them, self-help being evoked, and helped over initial difficulties
which would otherwise be insuperable. Experience in fact
shows that governments can do a very great deal, at least for
agricultural co-operation, but only on condition that they
encourage, and do not undermine, self-help and private initiative.
Thus while voluntary association is sometimes advocated as a
step towards, and sometimes on the other hand as a substitute for,
and bulwark against, state socialism, we find in practice these
two forces working each in its own sphere, and in ways complementary
one to the other, while underlying and essential to
both is the force of individual action and self-help.</p>

<p>We have now surveyed co-operation in its chief forms and in
some of the countries where it is chiefly found. Some years ago
it was roughly estimated that the members of one or
other of its branches numbered six millions, representing
<span class="sidenote">Conclusion.</span>
with their families a population of 25,000,000
people. This must be much within the truth to-day. In no
other country so much as in Great Britain do we find the tendency
for all branches of co-operation to federate in one union and to
help one another by mutual trade. Yet everywhere the instinct
of co-operative societies is to federate with others&mdash;at least with
others of their own particular shade; so that Wholesales and
other federations are found more and more in many countries.
Since 1895 the co-operators and co-operative societies of many
far-distant lands&mdash;almost of the whole world&mdash;have been drawn
together by the International Co-operative Alliance, a body
which, without attempting to interfere in their differences,
collects information from all, and distributes it to all, keeps
them all in touch, and every few years calls their delegates together
in congress, to discuss their problems, and to remember
their common ideals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPERSTOWN,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a village and the county-seat of Otsego
county, New York, U.S.A., where the Susquehanna river emerges
from Otsego Lake; about 92 m. (by rail) W. of Albany. Pop.
(1890) 2657; (1900) 2368; (1905) 2446; (1910) 2484. It is
served by the Cooperstown &amp; Charlotte Valley railway (owned
and controlled by the Delaware &amp; Hudson), and is on the line of
the Oneonta &amp; Mohawk Valley electric railway. The village
lies in the midst of a hop-growing and dairying region, and has
cheese factories and creameries. It has a public library, Thanksgiving
hospital, a Y.M.C.A. hall, and the Diocesan orphanage
(Protestant Episcopal). Cooperstown is a summer resort,
Otsego Lake (9 m. long and with an average width of about 1 m.),
the &ldquo;Glimmerglass&rdquo; of Cooper&rsquo;s novels, being one of the most
picturesque of the New York lakes. Cooperstown occupies the
site of an old Indian town. In 1785 the site became the property
of Judge William Cooper, who in the following year founded there
a village which took his name and was incorporated in 1807.
Judge Cooper himself settled here with his family in 1790. His
son, James Fenimore Cooper, who lived here for many years
and is buried in the Episcopal cemetery here, made the region
famous in his novels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOPER UNION,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a unique educational and charitable institution
&ldquo;for the advancement of science and art&rdquo; in New York
city. It is housed in a brownstone building in Astor Place,
between 3rd and 4th Avenues immediately N. of the Bowery,
and was founded in 1857-1859 by Peter Cooper, and chartered
in 1859. In a letter to the trustees accompanying the trust-deed
to the property, Cooper said that he wished the endowment to
be &ldquo;for ever devoted to the advancement of science and art, in
their application to the varied and useful purposes of life&rdquo;;
provided for a reading-room, a school of art for women, and an
office in the Union, &ldquo;where persons may apply ... for the
services of young men and women of known character and
qualifications to fill the various situations&rdquo;; expressed the
desire that students have monthly meetings held in due form,
&ldquo;as I believe it to be a very important part of the education
of an American citizen to know how to preside with propriety
over a deliberative assembly&rdquo;; urged lectures and debates
exclusive of theological and party questions; and required that
no religious test should ever be made for admission to the Union.
Cooper&rsquo;s most efficient assistant in the Union was Abram S.
Hewitt. In 1900 Andrew Carnegie put the finances of the Union
on a sure footing by gifts aggregating $600,000. For the year
1907 its revenue was $161,228 (including extraordinary receipts
of $25,565, from bequests, &amp;c.), its expenditures $161,390; at
the same time its assets were $3,870,520, of which $1,070,877
was general endowment, building and equipment, and $2,797,728
was special endowments ($205,000 being various endowments
by Peter Cooper; $340,000, the William Cooper Foundation;
$600,000, the Cooper-Hewitt Foundation; $391,656, the John
Halstead Bequest; $217,820, the Hewitt Memorial Endowment).
The work has been very successful, the instruction is excellent,
and the interest of the pupils is eager. All courses are free.
The reading-room and library contain full files of current journals
and magazines; the library has the rare complete old and new
series of patent office reports, and in 1907 had 45,760 volumes;
in the same year there were 578,582 readers. There is an
excellent museum for the arts of decoration. Apart from
valuable lecture courses, the principal departments of the Union,
with their attendance in 1907, were: a night school of science&mdash;a
five-year course in general science (667) and in chemistry (154),
a three-year course in electricity (114), and a night school of art
(1333); a day school of technical science&mdash;four years in civil,
mechanical or electrical engineering&mdash;(237); a woman&rsquo;s art
school (282); a school of stenography and typewriting for
women (55); a school of telegraphy for women (31); a class in
elocution (96); and classes in oratory and debate (146). During
the year 2505 was the highest number in attendance at any time,
and then 3000 were on the waiting list.</p>

<p>In the great hall of the Union free lectures for the people are
given throughout the winter; one course, the Hewitt lectures,
in co-operation with Columbia University, &ldquo;of a very high
grade, corresponding more nearly to those given by the Lowell
Institute in Boston&rdquo;; six (in 1907) courses in co-operation with
the Board of Education of New York city, which, upon Mayor
Hewitt&rsquo;s suggestion, made an appropriation for this work in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
1887-1888, and extended such lecture courses to different parts
of the city, all under the direction (after 1890) of Henry M.
Leipziger (b. 1854), and several courses dealing especially with
social and political subjects, and including, besides lectures and
recitals, public meetings for the discussion of current problems.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CO-OPTATION<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>co-optare</i>; less correctly &ldquo;co-option&rdquo;),
the election to vacancies on a legislative, administrative
or other body by the votes of the existing members of the body,
instead of by an outside constituency. Such bodies may be
purely co-optative, as the Royal Academy, or may be elective
with power to add to the numbers by co-optation, as municipal
corporations in England.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COORG<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (an anglicized corruption of <i>Kodagu</i>, said to be derived
from the Kanarese <i>Kudu</i>, &ldquo;steep,&rdquo; &ldquo;hilly&rdquo;), a province of India,
administered by a commissioner, subordinate to the governor-general
through the resident of Mysore, who is officially also
chief commissioner of Coorg. It lies in the south of the peninsula,
on the plateau of the Western Ghats, sloping inland towards
Mysore. It is an attractive field of coffee cultivation, though
the greater part is still under forest, but the prosperity of the
industry has declined since 1891. The administrative headquarters
are at Mercara (pop. 6732). Coorg is the smallest
province in India, its area being only 1582 sq. m. Of this
amount about 1000 sq. m. consist of ghat, reserved and other
forests. Coorg was constituted a province not on account of
its size, but on account of its isolation. It lies at the top of the
Western Ghats, and is cut off by them from easy communication
with the British districts of South Kanara and Malabar, which
form its western and southern boundaries, while on its other
sides it is surrounded by the native state of Mysore. It is a
mountainous district, presenting throughout a series of wooded
hills and deep valleys; the lowest elevations are 3000 ft. above
sea-level. The loftiest peak, Tadiandamol, has an altitude of
5729 ft.; Pushpagiri, another peak, is 5626 ft. high. The principal
river is the Cauvery, which rises on the eastern side of
the Western Ghats, and with its tributaries drains the greater
part of Coorg. Besides these there are several large streams
that take their rise in Coorg. In the rainy season, which lasts
during the continuance of the southwest monsoon, or from June
to the end of September, the rivers flow with violence and great
rapidity. In July and August the rainfall is excessive, and the
month of November is often showery. The yearly rainfall may
exceed 160 in.; in the dense jungle tract it reaches from 120 to
150; in the bamboo district in the west from 60 to 100 in. The
climate, though humid, is on the whole healthy; it is believed
to have been rendered hotter and drier by the clearing of forest
land. Coorg has an average temperature of about 60° F., the
extremes being 52° and 82°. The hottest season is in April and
May. In the direction of Mysore the whole country is thickly
wooded; but to the westward the forests are more open. The
flora of the jungle includes <i>Michelia</i> (Chumpak), <i>Mesua</i> (Ironwood),
<i>Diospyros</i> (Ebony and other species), <i>Cedrela toona</i>
(White cedar), <i>Chickrassia tubularis</i> (Red cedar), <i>Calophyllum
angustifolium</i> (Poon spar), <i>Canarium strictum</i> (Black Dammar
tree), <i>Artocarpus</i>, <i>Dipterocarpus</i>, <i>Garcinia</i>, <i>Euonymus</i>, <i>Cinnamomum
iners</i>, <i>Myristica</i>, <i>Vaccinium</i>, <i>Myrtaceae</i>, <i>Melastomaceae</i>,
<i>Rubus</i> (three species), and a rose. In the undergrowth are found
cardamom, areca, plantain, canes, wild pepper, tree and other
ferns, and arums. In the forest of the less thickly-wooded
bamboo country in the west of Coorg the trees most common
are the <i>Dalbergia latifolia</i> (Black wood), <i>Pterocarpus marsupium</i>
(Kino tree), <i>Terminalia coriacea</i> (Mutti), <i>Lagerströmia parviflora</i>
(Benteak), <i>Conocarpus lalifolius</i> (Dindul), <i>Bassia latifolia</i>, <i>Butea
frondosa</i>, <i>Nauclea parviflora</i>, and several acacias, with which, in
the eastern part of the district, teak and sandalwood occur.
Among the fauna may be mentioned the elephant, tiger, tiger-cat,
cheetah or hunting leopard, wild dog, elk, bison, wild boar,
several species of deer, hares, monkeys, the buceros and various
other birds, the cobra di capello, and a few alligators. The most
interesting antiquities of Coorg are the earth redoubts or war-trenches
(<i>kadangas</i>), which are from 15 to 25 ft. high, and provided
with a ditch 10 ft. deep by 8 or 10 ft. wide. Their linear extent is
reckoned at between 500 and 600 m. They are mentioned in
inscriptions of the 9th and 10th centuries. The exports of
Coorg are mainly rice, coffee and cardamoms; and the only
important manufacture is a kind of coarse blanket. Fruits of
many descriptions, especially oranges, are produced in abundance,
and are of excellent quality.</p>

<p>In 1901 the population was 180,607, showing an increase of
4.4% in the decade. Of the various tribes inhabiting Coorg,
the Coorgs proper, or Kodagas, and the Yeravas, or Eravas, both
special to the country, are the most numerous. The Kodagas
(36,091) are a light-coloured race of unknown origin. They
constitute a highland clan, free from the trammels of caste, and
they have the manly bearing and independent spirit natural in
men who have been from time immemorial the lords of the soil.
Their religion consists of ancestor- and demon-worship, with a
certain admixture of Brahman cults. The men are by tradition
warriors and hunters, and while they will plough the fields and
reap the rice, they leave all menial work to the women and servants.
They speak Kodagu, a dialect of Hala Kannada or old Kanarese,
midway between that and Malay&#257;lam. It has been asserted
that the institution of polyandry was prevalent among them,
according to which the brothers of a family had their wives in
common. But if this institution ever existed it no longer does
so. The Yeravas (14,586) are a race of an altogether inferior
type, dark-skinned and thick-lipped, resembling the Australian
aborigines who possibly, according to one theory, may have
sprung from the same Dravidian stock (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Australia</a></span>: <i>Aborigines</i>).
Though now nominally free, they were, before the
establishment of British rule, the hereditary praedial slaves of
the Kodagas. Some of them live a primitive life in the jungle,
but the majority earn a livelihood as coolies. They are demon-worshippers,
their favourite deity being Karingali (black Kali).
Their language, a dialect of Malay&#257;lam, is peculiar to them.
Among the other tribes or castes special to Coorg are the Heggades
(1503 in 1901), cultivators from Malabar; the Ayiri (898), who
constitute the artisan caste; the Medas (584), who are basket-
and mat-makers, and act as drummers at feasts; the Binepatta
(98), originally wandering musicians from Malabar, now agriculturists;
the Kavadi (49), cultivators from Yeden&#257;lkn&#257;d;
all these speak the Coorg language, wear the Coorg dress, and
conform, more or less, to Coorg customs. Other tribes are not
special to Coorg. Of these the Holeyas (27,000) are the most
numerous. They are divided into four sections: Badagas from
Mysore, Kembattis and M&#257;ringis from Malabar, Kukkas from
S. Kanara. They were formerly the slaves of the Kodagas and
now act as their menials. The Lingayats (8700) are rather a
religious sect than a tribe. Of the Tulu (farmer) class the
Gaudas (11,900), who live principally along the western boundary,
are the most important; they speak Tulu and wear the Coorg
dress. Other castes and tribes are the Tiyas (1500) and Nayars
(1400), immigrants from Malay&#257;lam; the Vellala (1300), who
are Tamils; the Mahrattas (2400) and Brahmans (1100). Of
the Mussulmans the most numerous are the Moplahs (6700) and
the Shaikhs (4400), both chiefly traders. Of native Christians
there are upwards of 3000. The official language of Coorg,
which is that spoken by 45% of the population, is Kanarese
(Kannada), the Coorg language (Kodagu) coming next. The
Coorg dress is very picturesque, its characteristics being a long
coat (Kupasa), of dark-coloured cloth, reaching below the knees,
folded across and confined at the waist by a red or blue girdle.
The sleeves are cut off below the elbow, showing the arms of a
white shirt. The head-dress is a red kerchief, or a peculiar
large, flat turban, covering the back of the neck. The Coorg
also carries a short knife, with an ivory or silver hilt, fastened
with silver chains and stuck into the girdle. A large, broad-bladed
waist knife, akin to the <i>kukri</i> of the Gurkhas, worn at
the back, point upwards, was formerly a formidable weapon
in hand-to-hand fighting, but is now used only for exhibitions
of strength and skill on festive occasions.</p>

<p>The chief crops are rice and coffee. Some abandoned coffee
land has been planted with tea as an experiment. The cultivation
of cinchona has proved unprofitable. There is no railway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
There are no colleges, but twenty-four scholarships are given
to maintain Coorg students at colleges in Madras and Mysore.
There are secondary schools at Mercara and Virarajendrapet.</p>

<p>The early accounts of Coorg are purely legendary, and it was
not till the 9th and 10th centuries that its history became the
subject of authentic record. At this period, according to inscriptions,
the country was ruled by the Gangas of Talak&#257;d,
under whom the Changalvas, kings of Changa-n&#257;d, styled later
kings of Nanjarayapatna or Nanjarajapatna, held the east and
part of the north of Coorg, together with the Hunsur <i>tal&#363;k</i> in
Mysore. After the overthrow, in the 11th century, of the Ganga
power by the Cholas, the Changalvas became tributary to the
latter. When the Cholas in their turn were driven from the
Mysore country by the Hoysalas, in the 12th century, the
Changalvas held out for independence; but after a severe
struggle they were subdued and became vassals of the Hoysala
kings. In the 14th century, after the fall of the Hoysala rule,
they passed under the supremacy of the Vijayanagar empire.
During this period, at the beginning of the 16th century, Nanja
Raja founded the new Changalva capital Nanjarajapatna. In
1589 Piriya Raja or Rudragana rebuilt Singapatna and renamed
it Piriyapatna (Periapatam). The power of the Vijayanagar
empire had, however, been broken in 1565 by the Mahommedans;
in 1610 the Vijayanagar viceroy of Seringapatam was ousted
by the raja of Mysore, who in 1644 captured Piriyapatna. Vira
Raja, the last of the Changalva kings, fell in the defence of his
capital, after putting to death his wives and children.</p>

<p>Coorg, however, was not absorbed in Mysore, which was hard
pressed by other enemies, and a prince of the Ikkeri or Bednur
family (perhaps related to the Changalvas) succeeded in bringing
the whole country under his sway, his descendants continuing
to be rajas of Coorg till 1834. The capital was removed in 1681
by Muddu Raja to Madikeri or Mercara. In 1770 a disputed
succession led to the intervention of Hyder Ali of Mysore in
favour of Linga Raja, who had fled to him for help, and whom
he placed on the throne on his consenting to cede certain territories
and to pay tribute. On Linga Raja&rsquo;s death in 1780 Hyder
Ali interned his sons, who were minors, in a fort in Mysore, and,
under pretence of acting as their guardian, installed a Brahman
governor at Mercara with a Mussulman garrison. In 1782,
however, the Coorgs rose in rebellion and drove out the Mahommedans.
Two years later Tippoo Sultan reduced the country;
but the Coorgs having again rebelled in 1785 he vowed their
destruction. Having secured some 70,000 of them by treachery,
he drove them to Seringapatam, where he had them circumcised
by force. Coorg was partitioned among Mussulman
proprietors, and held down by garrisons in four forts. In 1788,
however, Vira Raja (or Vira Rajendra Wodeyar), with his wife
and his brothers Linga Raja and Appaji, succeeded in escaping
from his captivity, at Periapatam and, placing himself at the
head of a Coorg rebellion, succeeded in driving the forces of
Tippoo out of the country. The British, who were about to
enter on the struggle with Tippoo, now made a treaty with Vira
Raja; and during the war that followed the Coorgs proved
invaluable allies. By the treaty of peace Coorg, though not
adjacent to the East India Company&rsquo;s territories, was included
in the cessions forced upon Tippoo. On the spot where he had
first met the British commander, General Abercromby, the
raja founded the city of Virarajendrapet.</p>

<p>Vira Raja, who, in consequence of his mind becoming unhinged,
was guilty towards the end of his reign of hideous atrocities,
died in 1809 without male heirs, leaving his favourite daughter
Devamm&#257;ji as rani. His brother Linga Raja, however, after
acting as regent for his niece, announced in 1811 his own assumption
of the government. He died in 1820, and was succeeded by
his son Vira Raja, a youth of twenty, and a monster of sensuality
and cruelty. Among his victims were all the members of the
families of his predecessors, including Devamm&#257;ji. At last, in
1832, evidence of treasonable designs on the raja&rsquo;s part led to
inquiries on the spot by the British resident at Mysore, as the
result of which, and of the raja&rsquo;s refusal to amend his ways, a
British force marched into Coorg in 1834. On the 11th of April
the raja was deposed by Colonel Fraser, the political agent with
the force, and on the 7th of May the state was formally annexed
to the East India Company&rsquo;s territory. In 1852 the raja, who
had been deported to Vellore, obtained leave to visit England
with his favourite daughter Gauramma, to whom he wished to
give a European education. On the 30th of June she was
baptized, Queen Victoria being one of her sponsors; she afterwards
married a British officer who, after her death in 1864,
mysteriously disappeared together with their child. Vira Raja
himself died in 1863, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.</p>

<p>The so-called Coorg rebellion of 1837 was really a rising of the
Gaudas, due to the grievance felt in having to pay taxes in
money instead of in kind. A man named Virappa, who pretended
to have escaped from the massacre of 1820, tried to take
advantage of this to assert his claim to be raja, but the Coorgs
remained loyal to the British and the attempt failed. In 1861,
after the Mutiny, the loyalty of the Coorgs was rewarded by their
being exempted from the Disarmament Act.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COORNHERT, DIRCK VOLCKERTSZOON<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (1522-1590), Dutch
politician and theologian, youngest son of Volckert Coornhert,
cloth merchant, was born at Amsterdam in 1522. As a child he
spent some years in Spain and Portugal. Returning home, he
was disinherited by his father&rsquo;s will, for his marriage with Cornelia
(Neeltje) Simons, a portionless gentlewoman. He took for a
time the post of major-domo to Reginald (Reinoud), count of
Brederode. Soon he settled in Haarlem, as engraver on copper,
and produced works which retain high values. Learning Latin,
he published Dutch translations from Cicero, Seneca and Boetius.
He was appointed secretary to the city (1562) and secretary to
the burgomasters (1564). Throwing himself into the struggle
with Spanish rule, he drew up the manifesto of William of
Orange (1566). Imprisoned at the Hague (1568), he escaped
to Cleves, where he maintained himself by his art. Recalled
in 1572, he was secretary of state for a short time; his aversion
to military violence led him to return to Cleves, where William
continued to employ his services and his pen. As a religious
man, he wrote and strove in favour of tolerance, being decidedly
against capital punishment for heretics. He had no party views;
the Heidelberg catechism, authoritative in Holland, he criticized.
The great Arminius, employed to refute him, was won over by
his arguments. He died at Gouda on the 29th of October 1590.
His Dutch version of the New Testament, following the Latin of
Erasmus, was never completed. His works, in prose and verse,
were published in 1630, 3 vols.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOT,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> a well-known water-fowl, the <i>Fulica atra</i> of Linnaeus,
belonging to the family <i>Rallidae</i> or rails. The word coot, in
some parts of England pronounced cute, or scute, is of uncertain
origin, but perhaps cognate with scout and scoter&mdash;both names
of aquatic birds&mdash;a possibility which seems to be more likely
since the name &ldquo;macreuse,&rdquo; by which the coot is known in the
south of France, being in the north of that country applied to
the scoter (<i>Oedemia nigra</i>) shows that, though belonging to very
different families, there is in popular estimation some connexion
between the two birds.<a name="FnAnchor_1f" id="FnAnchor_1f" href="#Footnote_1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The Latin <i>Fulica</i> (in polite French,
<i>Foulque</i>) is probably allied to <i>fuligo</i>, and has reference to the
bird&rsquo;s dark colour.<a name="FnAnchor_2f" id="FnAnchor_2f" href="#Footnote_2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The coot breeds abundantly in many of
the larger inland waters of the northern parts of the Old World,
in winter commonly resorting, and often in great numbers, to
the mouth of rivers or shallow bays of the sea, where it becomes
a general object of pursuit by gunners whether for sport or gain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
At other times of the year it is comparatively unmolested, and
being very prolific its abundance is easily understood. The nest
is a large mass of flags, reeds or sedge, piled together among
rushes in the water or on the margin, and not unfrequently
contains as many as ten eggs. The young, when first hatched,
are beautiful little creatures, clothed in jet-black down, with
their heads of a bright orange-scarlet, varied with purplish-blue.
This brilliant colouring is soon lost, and they begin to assume the
almost uniform sooty-black plumage which is worn for the rest of
their life; but a characteristic of the adult is a bare patch or
callosity on the forehead, which being nearly white gives rise
to the epithet &ldquo;bald&rdquo; often prefixed to the bird&rsquo;s name. The
coot is about 18 in. in length, and will sometimes weigh over 2 &#8468;.
Though its wings appear to be short in proportion to its size,
and it seems to rise with difficulty from the water, it is capable
of long-sustained and rather rapid flight, which is performed
with the legs stretched out behind the stumpy tail. It swims
buoyantly, and looks a much larger bird in the water than it
really is. It dives with ease, and when wounded is said frequently
to clutch the weeds at the bottom with a grasp so firm as not
even to be loosened by death. It does not often come on dry
land, but when there, marches leisurely and not without a certain
degree of grace. The feet of the coot are very remarkable, the
toes being fringed by a lobed membrane, which must be of
considerable assistance in swimming as well as in walking over
the ooze&mdash;acting as they do like mud-boards.</p>

<p>In England the sport of coot-shooting is pursued to some
extent on the broads and back-waters of the eastern counties&mdash;in
Southampton Water and Christchurch Bay&mdash;and is often
conducted battue-fashion by a number of guns. But even in
these cases the numbers killed in a day seldom reach more than
a few hundreds, and come very short of those that fall in the
officially-organized <i>chasses</i> of the lakes near the coast of Languedoc
and Provence, of which an excellent description is given by
the Vicomte Louis de Dax (<i>Nouveaux Souvenirs de chasse</i>, &amp;c.,
pp. 53-65; Paris, 1860). The flesh of the coot is very variously
regarded as food. To prepare the bird for the table, the feathers
should be stripped, and the down, which is very close, thick and
hard to pluck, be rubbed with powdered resin; the body is then
to be dipped in boiling water, which dissolving the resin causes
it to mix with the down, and then both can be removed together
with tolerable ease. After this the bird should be left to soak
for the night in cold spring-water, which will make it look as
white and delicate as a chicken. Without this process the skin
after roasting is found to be very oily, with a fishy flavour, and
if the skin be taken off the flesh becomes dry and good for nothing
(Hawker&rsquo;s <i>Instructions to Young Sportsmen</i>; Hele&rsquo;s <i>Notes about
Aldeburgh</i>).</p>

<p>The coot is found throughout the Palaearctic region from
Iceland to Japan, and in most other parts of the world is represented
by nearly allied species, having almost the same habits.
An African species (<i>F. cristata</i>), easily distinguished by two
red knobs on its forehead, is of rare appearance in the south
of Europe. The Australian and North American species (<i>F.
australis</i> and <i>F. americana</i>) have very great resemblance to the
English bird; but in South America half-a-dozen or more
additional species are found which range to Patagonia, and vary
much in size, one (<i>F. gigantea</i>) being of considerable magnitude.
The remains of a very large species (<i>F. newtoni</i>) were discovered
in Mauritius, where it must have been a contemporary
of the dodo, but like that bird is now extinct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COOTE, SIR EYRE<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1726-1783), British soldier, the son of
a clergyman, was born near Limerick, and entered the 27th
regiment. He saw active service in the Jacobite rising of 1745,
and some years later obtained a captaincy in the 39th regiment,
which was the first British regiment sent to India. In 1756 a
part of the regiment, then quartered at Madras, was sent forward
to join Clive in his operations against Calcutta, which was reoccupied
without difficulty, and Coote was soon given the local
rank of major for his good conduct in the surprise of the Nawab&rsquo;s
camp. Soon afterwards came the battle of Plassey, which would
in all probability not have taken place but for Coote&rsquo;s soldierly
advice at the council of war; and after the defeat of the Nawab
he led a detachment in pursuit of the French for 400 m. under
extraordinary difficulties. His conduct won him the rank of
lieutenant-colonel and the command of the 84th regiment,
newly-raised for Indian service, but his exertions seriously
injured his health. In October 1759 Coote&rsquo;s regiment arrived
to take part in the decisive struggle between French and English
in the Carnatic. He took command of the forces at Madras,
and in 1760 led them in the decisive victory of Wandiwash
(January 22). After a time the remnants of Lally&rsquo;s forces
were shut up in Pondicherry. For some reason Coote was not
entrusted with the siege operations, but he cheerfully and loyally
supported Monson, who brought the siege to a successful end
on the 15th of January 1761. Soon afterwards Coote was given
the command of the East India Company&rsquo;s forces in Bengal,
and conducted the settlement of a serious dispute between the
Nawab Mir Cassim and a powerful subordinate, and in 1762 he
returned to England, receiving a jewelled sword of honour from
the Company and other rewards for his great services. In 1771
he was made a K.B. In 1779 he returned to India as lieutenant-general
commanding in chief. Following generally the policy
of Warren Hastings, he nevertheless refused to take sides in the
quarrels of the council, and made a firm stand in all matters
affecting the forces. Hyder Ali&rsquo;s progress in southern India
called him again into the field, but his difficulties were very
great and it was not until the 1st of June 1781 that the crushing
and decisive defeat of Porto Novo struck the first heavy blow
at Hyder&rsquo;s schemes. The battle was won by Coote under most
unfavourable conditions against odds of five to one, and is
justly ranked as one of the greatest feats of the British in India.
It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur
(the scene of an earlier triumph of Hyder over a British force)
on the 27th of August, in which the British won another success,
and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholingarh a month
later. His last service was the arduous campaign of 1782,
which finally shattered a constitution already gravely impaired
by hardship and exertions. Sir Eyre Coote died at Madras on
the 28th of April 1783. A monument was erected to him in
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPAIBA,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Copaiva</span> (from Brazilian <i>cupauba</i>), an oleo-resin&mdash;sometimes
termed a balsam&mdash;obtained from the trunk of the
<i>Copaifera Lansdorfii</i> (natural order Leguminosae) and from
other species of <i>Copaifera</i> found in the West Indies and in the
valley of the Amazon. It is a somewhat viscous transparent
liquid, occasionally fluorescent and of a light yellow to pale
golden colour. The odour is aromatic and very characteristic,
the taste acrid and bitter. It is insoluble in water, but soluble
in absolute alcohol, ether and the fixed and volatile oils. Its
approximate composition is more than 50% of a volatile oil
and less than 50% of a resin. The pharmacopoeias contain
the oleo-resin itself, which is given in doses of from a half to one
drachm, and the <i>oleum copaibae</i>, which is given in doses of from
five to twenty minims, but which is inferior, as a medicinal agent,
to the oleo-resin. Copaiba shares the pharmacological characters
of volatile oils generally. Its distinctive features are its disagreeable
taste and the unpleasant eructations to which it may give
rise, its irritant action on the intestine in any but small doses,
its irritant action on the skin, often giving rise to an erythematous
eruption which may be mistaken for that of scarlet fever, and
its exceptionally marked stimulant action on the kidneys. In
large doses this last action may lead to renal inflammation. The
resin is excreted in the urine and is continually mistaken for
albumin since it is precipitated by nitric acid, but the precipitate
is re-dissolved, unlike albumin, on heating. Its nasty taste, its
irritant action on the bowel, and its characteristic odour in the
breath, prohibit its use&mdash;despite its other advantages&mdash;in all
diseases but gonorrhoea. For this disease it is a valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
remedy, but it must not be administered until the acute symptoms
have subsided, else it will often increase them. It is best given
in cachets or in three times its own bulk of mucilage of acacia.
Various devices are adopted to disguise its odour in the breath.
The clinical evidence clearly shows that none of the numerous
vegetable rivals to copaiba is equal to it in therapeutic value.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPAL<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (Mexican <i>copalli</i>, incense), a hard lustrous resin,
varying in hue from an almost colourless transparent mass to a
bright yellowish-brown, having a conchoidal fracture, and, when
dissolved in alcohol, spirit of turpentine, or any other suitable
menstruum, forming one of the most valuable varnishes. Copal
is obtained from a variety of sources; the term is not uniformly
applied or restricted to the products of any particular region or
series of plants, but is vaguely used for resins which, though
very similar in their physical properties, differ somewhat in
their constitution, and are altogether distinct as to their source.
Thus the resin obtained from <i>Trachylobium Hornemannianum</i> is
known in commerce as Zanzibar copal, or gum animé. Madagascar
copal is the produce of <i>T. verrucosum</i>. From <i>Guibourtia
copallifera</i> is obtained Sierra Leone copal, and another variety
of the same resin is found in a fossil state on the west coast of
Africa, probably the produce of a tree now extinct. From
Brazil and other South American countries, again, copal is
obtained which is yielded by <i>Trachylobium Martianum</i>, <i>Hymenaea
Courbaril</i>, and various other species, while the dammar resins
and the piney varnish of India are occasionally classed and
spoken of as copal. Of the varieties above enumerated by far
the most important from a commercial point of view is the
Zanzibar or East African copal, yielded by <i>Trachylobium Hornemannianum</i>.
The resin is found in two distinct conditions:
(1) raw or recent, called by the inhabitants of the coast sandarusiza
miti or chakazi, the latter name being corrupted by
Zanzibar traders into &ldquo;jackass&rdquo; copal; and (2) ripe or true
copal, the sandarusi inti of the natives. The raw copal, which
is obtained direct from the trees, or found at their roots or near
the surface of the ground, is not regarded by the natives as of
much value, and does not enter into European commerce. It
is sent to India and China, where it is manufactured into a
coarse kind of varnish. The true or fossil copal is found embedded
in the earth over a wide belt of the mainland coast of Zanzibar,
on tracts where not a single tree is now visible. The copal is not
found at a greater depth in the ground than 4 ft., and it is
seldom the diggers go deeper than about 3 ft. It occurs in
pieces varying from the size of small pebbles up to masses of
several ounces in weight, and occasionally lumps weighing 4
or 5 &#8468; have been obtained. After being freed from foreign
matter, the resin is submitted to various chemical operations
for the purpose of clearing the &ldquo;goose-skin,&rdquo; the name given
to the peculiar pitted-like surface possessed by fossil copal.
The goose-skin was formerly supposed to be caused by the
impression of the small stones and sand of the soil into which
the soft resin fell in its raw condition; but it appears that the
copal when first dug up presents no trace of the goose-skin, the
subsequent appearance of which is due to oxidation or inter-molecular
change.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPALITE,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Copaline</span>, also termed &ldquo;fossil resin&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Highgate resin,&rdquo; a naturally occurring organic substance
found as irregular pieces of pale-yellow colour in the London
clay at Highgate Hill. It has a resinous aromatic odour when
freshly broken, volatilizes at a moderate temperature, and burns
readily with a yellow, smoky flame, leaving scarcely any ash.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPARCENARY<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (<i>co-</i>, with, and <i>parcener</i>, <i>i.e.</i> sharer; from
O. Fr. <i>parçonier</i>, Lat. <i>partitio</i>, division), in law, the descent of
lands of inheritance from an ancestor to two or more persons
possessing an equal title to them. It arises either by common
law, as where an ancestor dies intestate, leaving two or more
females as his co-heiresses, who then take as coparceners or
parceners; or, by particular custom, as in the case of gavelkind
lands, which descend to all males in equal degrees, or in default
of males, to all the daughters equally. These co-heirs, or
parceners, have been so called, says Littleton (§ 241), &ldquo;because
by writ the law will constrain them, that partition shall be made
among them.&rdquo; Coparcenary so far resembles joint tenancy in
that there is unity of title, interest and possession, but whereas
joint tenants always claim by purchase, parceners claim by
descent, and although there is unity of interest there is no
entirety, for there is no <i>jus accrescendi</i> or survivorship. Coparcenary
may be dissolved (a) by partition; (b) by alienation
by one coparcener; (c) by all the estate at last descending to one
coparcener, who thenceforth holds in severalty; (d) by a compulsory
partition or sale under the Partition Acts.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;coparcenary&rdquo; is not in use in the United States,
joint heirship being considered as <i>tenancy in common</i>.</p>

American fossil vertebrata he gave his special attention. From

<p><span class="bold">COPE, EDWARD MEREDITH<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1818-1873), English classical
scholar, was born in Birmingham on the 28th of July 1818. He
was educated at Ludlow and Shrewsbury schools and Trinity
College, Cambridge, of which society he was elected fellow in
1842, having taken his degree in 1841 as senior classic. He was
for many years lecturer at Trinity, his favourite subjects being
the Greek tragedians, Plato and Aristotle. When the professorship
of Greek became vacant, the votes were equally divided
between Cope and B. H. Kennedy, and the latter was appointed

was partly responsible for the mental affliction
by which he was attacked in 1869, and from which he never
recovered. He died on the 5th of August 1873. As his published

a tendency to over-minuteness. He was the author of <i>An

liturgical vestment of the Western Church. The word &ldquo;cope,&rdquo;
now confined to this sense, was in its origin identical with &ldquo;cape&rdquo;
and &ldquo;cap,&rdquo; and was used until comparatively modern times also
for an out-door cloak, whether worn by clergy or laity. This,
indeed, was its original meaning, the <i>cappa</i> having been an outer
garment common to men and women whether clerical or lay (see
Du Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>, s.v.). The word <i>pluviale</i> (rain-cloak),
which the cope bears in the Roman Church, is exactly parallel
so far as change of meaning is concerned. In both words the
etymology reveals the origin of the vestment, which is no more
than a glorified survival of an article of clothing worn by all and
sundry in ordinary life, the type of which survives, <i>e.g.</i> in the
ample hooded cloak of Italian military officers. This origin is
clearly traceable in the shape and details of the cope. When
spread out this forms an almost complete semicircle. Along the
straight edge there is usually a broad band, and at the neck is
attached the &ldquo;hood&rdquo; (in Latin, the <i>clypeus</i> or shield), <i>i.e.</i> a
shield-shaped piece of stuff which hangs down over the back.
The vestment is secured in front by a broad tab sewn on to one
side and fastening to the other with hooks, sometimes also by a
brooch (called the morse, Lat. <i>morsus</i>). Sometimes the morse
is attached as a mere ornament to the cross-piece. The cope
thus preserves the essential shape of its secular original, and
even the hood, though now a mere ornamental appendage, is a
survival of an actual hood. The evolution of this latter into its
present form was gradual; first the hood became too small for
use, then it was transformed into a small triangular piece of stuff
(13th century), which in its turn grew (14th and 15th centuries)
into the shape of a shield (see Plate II., fig. 4), and this again,
losing its pointed tip in the 17th century, expanded in the 18th
into a flap which was sometimes enlarged so as to cover the
whole back down to the waist. In its general effect, however,
a cope now no longer suggests a &ldquo;waterproof.&rdquo; It is sometimes
elaborately embroidered all over; more usually it is of some rich
material, with the borders in front and the hood embroidered,
while the morse has given occasion for some of the most beautiful
examples of the goldsmith&rsquo;s and jeweller&rsquo;s craft (see Plate II.,
figs, 5, 6).</p>

<p>The use of the cope as a liturgical vestment can be traced to
the end of the 8th century: a <i>pluviale</i> is mentioned in the
foundation charter of the monastery of Obona in Spain. Before
this the so-called <i>cappa choralis</i>, a black, bell-shaped, hooded
vestment with no liturgical significance, had been worn by the
secular and regular clergy at choir services, processions, &amp;c.
This was in its origin identical with the chasuble (<i>q.v.</i>), and if,
as Father Braun seems to prove, the cope developed out of this,
cope and chasuble have a common source.<a name="FnAnchor_1g" id="FnAnchor_1g" href="#Footnote_1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Father Braun cites
numerous inventories and the like to show that the cope (<i>pluviale</i>)
was originally no more than a more elaborate <i>cappa</i> worn on
high festivals or other ceremonial occasions, sometimes by the
whole religious community, sometimes&mdash;if the stock were
limited&mdash;by those, <i>e.g.</i> the cantors, &amp;c., who were most conspicuous
in the ceremony. In the 10th century, partly under
the influence of the wealthy and splendour-loving community
of Cluny, the use of the cope became very widespread; in the
11th century it was universally worn, though the rules for its
ritual use had not yet been fixed. It was at this time, however,
<i>par excellence</i> the vestment proper to the cantors, choirmaster
and singers, whose duty it was to sing the <i>invitatorium</i>, <i>responses</i>,
&amp;c., at office, and the <i>introitus</i>, <i>graduale</i>, &amp;c., at Mass. This use
survived in the ritual of the pre-Reformation Church in England,
and has been introduced in certain Anglican churches, <i>e.g.</i>
St Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s, Munster Square, in London.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the 13th century the liturgical use of the
cope had become finally fixed, and the rules for this use included
by Pope Pius V. in the Roman Missal and by Clement VIII.
in the <i>Pontificale</i> and <i>Caeremoniale</i> were consequently not new,
but in accordance with ancient and universal custom. The
substitution of the cope for the chasuble in many of the functions
for which the latter had been formerly used was primarily due to
the comparative convenience of a vestment opened at the front,
and so leaving the arms free. A natural conservatism preserved
the chasuble, which by the 9th century had acquired a symbolical
significance, as the vestment proper to the celebration of Mass;
but the cope took its place in lesser functions, <i>i.e.</i> the censing of
the altar during the Magnificat and at Mattins (whence the
German name <i>Rauchmantel</i>, smoke-mantel), processions, solemn
consecrations, and as the dress of bishops attending synods.</p>

<p>It is clear from this that the cope, though a liturgical, was never
a sacerdotal vestment. If it was worn by priests, it could also
be worn by laymen, and it was
never worn by priests in their
sacerdotal, <i>i.e.</i> their sacrificial,
capacity. For this reason it was
not rejected with the &ldquo;Mass
vestments&rdquo; by the English
Church at the Reformation, in
spite of the fact that it was in
no ecclesiastical sense &ldquo;primitive.&rdquo;
By the First Prayer-book
of Edward VI., which represented
a compromise, it was
directed to be worn as an alternative
to the &ldquo;vestment&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
chasuble) at the celebration of
the Communion; this at least
seems the plain meaning of
the words &ldquo;vestment or
cope,&rdquo; though they have been
otherwise interpreted. In the
Second Prayer-book vestment
and cope alike disappear; but
a cope was worn by the prelate
who consecrated Archbishop
Parker, and by the &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; as well as the priests of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s chapel; and, finally, by the 24th canon (of 1603) a
&ldquo;decent cope&rdquo; was prescribed for the &ldquo;principal minister&rdquo; at the
celebration of Holy Communion in cathedral churches as well as
for the &ldquo;gospeller and epistler.&rdquo; Except at royal coronations,
however, the use of the cope, even in cathedrals, had practically
ceased in England before the ritual revival of the 19th century
restored its popularity. The disuse implied no doctrinal change;
the main motive was that the stiff vestment, high in the neck,
was incompatible with a full-bottomed wig. Scarlet copes with
white fur hoods have been in continuous use on ceremonial
occasions in the universities, and are worn by bishops at the
opening of parliament.</p>

<p>With the liturgical cope may be classed the red mantle (<i>mantum</i>),
which from the 11th century to the close of the middle ages
formed, with the tiara, the special symbol of the papal
dignity. The <i>immantatio</i> was the solemn investiture
<span class="sidenote">The Papal mantum.</span>
of the new pope immediately after his election, by
means of the <i>cappa rubea</i>, with the papal powers.
This ceremony was of great importance. In the contested
election of 1159, for instance, though a majority of the cardinals
had elected Cardinal Roland (Alexander III.), the defeated
candidate Cardinal Octavian (Victor IV.), while his rival was
modestly hesitating to accept the honour, seized the <i>pluviale</i>
and put it on his own shoulders hastily, upside down; and it
was on this ground that the council of Pavia in 1160 based their
declaration in favour of Victor, and anathematized Alexander.
The <i>immantatio</i> fell out of use during the papal exile at Avignon
and was never restored.</p>

<p>It will be convenient here to note other vestments that have
developed out of the <i>cappa</i>. The <i>cappa choralis</i> has already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
been mentioned; it survived as a choir vestment that in winter
took the place of the surplice, rochet or almuce. In the 12th
<span class="sidenote">The cappa magna.</span>
century it was provided with arms (<i>cappa manicata</i>),
but the use of this form was forbidden at choir services
and other liturgical functions. From the hood of the
<i>cappa</i> was developed the almuce (<i>q.v.</i>). At what
date the <i>cappa choralis</i> developed into the <i>cappa magna</i>, a
non-liturgical vestment peculiar to the pope, cardinals, bishops
and certain privileged prelates, is not known; but mention of it
is found as early as the 15th century. This vestment is a loose
robe, with a large hood (lined with fur in winter and red silk in
summer) and a long train, which is carried by a cleric called the
<i>caudatarius</i>. Its colour varies with the hierarchical rank of the
wearer:&mdash;red for cardinals, purple for bishops, &amp;c.; or, if the
dignitary belong to a religious order, it follows the colour of the
habit of the order. The right to wear a violet <i>cappa magna</i> is
conceded by the popes to the chapters of certain important
cathedrals, but the train in this case is worn folded over the
left arm or tied under it. It may only be worn by them, moreover,
in their own church, or when the chapter appears elsewhere
in its corporate capacity.</p>

<p>Lastly, from the <i>cappa</i> is probably derived the <i>mozzetta</i>, a short
cape with a miniature hood, fastened down the front with
buttons. The name is derived from the Italian
<span class="sidenote">The mozzetta.</span>
<i>mozzare</i>, to cut off, and points to its being an abbreviated
<i>cappa</i>, as the episcopal &ldquo;apron&rdquo; is a shortened
cassock. It is worn over the rochet by the pope, cardinals,
bishops and prelates, the colours varying as in the case of the
<i>cappa magna</i>. Its use as confined to bishops can be traced to
the 16th century.</p>

<p class="f80">The medallions with which it is embroidered contain representations of Christ on the Cross, Christ and St Mary Magdalene, Christ
and Thomas, the death of the Virgin, the burial and coronation of the Virgin, St Michael and the twelve Apostles. Of the latter, four
survive only in tiny fragments. The spaces between the four rows of medallions are filled with six-winged cherubim. The ground-work
of the vestment is green silk embroidery, that of the medallions red. The figures are worked in silver and gold thread and coloured silks.
The lower border and the orphrey with coats of arms do not belong to the original cope and are of somewhat later date. The cope belonged
to the convent of Syon near Isleworth, was taken to Portugal at the Reformation, brought back early in the 19th century to England by
exiled nuns and given by them to the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1864 it was bought by the South Kensington Museum.</p>

51, p. 39, 1894), is rejected by the five bishops in their report to
Convocation (1908). Their statement, however, that it is &ldquo;pretty
clear&rdquo; that the cope is derived from the Roman <i>lacerna</i> or <i>birrus</i> is
very much open to criticism. We do not even know what the
appearance and form of the <i>birrus</i> were; and the question of the
origin of the cope is not whether it was derived from any garment
of the time of the Roman Empire, and if so from which, but what
garment in use in the 8th and 9th centuries it represents.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPELAND, HENRY,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> an 18th century English cabinet-maker
and furniture designer. He appears to have been the first
manufacturing cabinet-maker who published designs for furniture.
<i>A New Book of Ornaments</i> appeared in 1746, but it is not
clear whether the engravings with this title formed part of a
book, or were issued only in separate plates; a few of the
latter are all that are known to exist. Between 1752 and 1769
several collections of designs were produced by Copeland in
conjunction with Matthias Lock; in one of them Copeland is
described as of Cheapside. Some of the original drawings are in
the National Art library at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Copeland was probably the originator of a peculiar type of chairback,
popular for a few years in the middle of the 18th century,
consisting of a series of interlaced circles. Much of his work has
been attributed to Thomas Chippendale, and it is certain that
one derived many ideas from the other, but which was the
originator and which the copyist is by no means clear. The
dates of Copeland&rsquo;s birth and death are unknown, but he was
still living in 1768.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPENHAGEN<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (Danish <i>Kjöbenhavn</i>), the capital of the
kingdom of Denmark, on the east coast of the island of Zealand
(<i>Sjaelland</i>) at the southern end of the Sound. Pop. (1901)
400,575. The latitude is approximately that of Moscow, Berwick-on-Tweed
and Hopedale in Labrador. The nucleus of the city
is built on low-lying ground on the east coast of the island of
Zealand, between the sea and a series of small freshwater lakes,
known respectively as St Jörgens Sö, Peblings Sö and Sortedams
Sö, a southern portion occupying the northern part of the island
of Amager. An excellent harbour is furnished by the natural
channel between the two islands; and communication from one
division to the other is afforded by two bridges&mdash;the Langebro
and the Knippelsbro, which replaced the wooden drawbridge
built by Christian IV. in 1620. The older city, including both
the Zealand and Amager portions, was formerly surrounded
by a complete line of ramparts and moats; but pleasant boulevards
and gardens now occupy the westward or landward site
of fortifications. Outside the lines of the original city (about
5 m. in circuit), there are extensive suburbs, especially on the
Zealand side (Österbro, Nörrebro and Vesterbro or Österfölled,
&amp;c., and Frederiksberg), and Amagerbro to the south of
Christianshavn.</p>

<p>The area occupied by the inner city is known as Gammelsholm
(old island). The main artery is the Gothersgade, running from
Kongens Nytorv to the western boulevards, and separating a
district of regular thoroughfares and rectangular blocks to the
north from one of irregular, narrow and picturesque streets to
the south. The Kongens Nytorv, the focus of the life of the city
and the centre of road communications, is an irregular open
space at the head of a narrow arm of the harbour (Nyhavn)
inland from the steamer quays, with an equestrian statue of
Christian V. (d. 1699) in the centre. The statue is familiarly
known as <i>Hesten</i> (the horse) and is surrounded by noteworthy
buildings. The Palace of Charlottenborg, on the east side,
which takes its name from Charlotte, the wife of Christian V.,
is a huge sombre building, built in 1672. Frederick V. made a
grant of it to the Academy of Arts, which holds its annual
exhibition of paintings and sculpture in April and May, in the
adjacent <i>Kunstudstilling</i> (1883). On the south is the principal
theatre, the Royal, a beautiful modern Renaissance building
(1874), on the site of a former theatre of the same name, which
dated from 1748. Statues of the poets Ludvig Holberg (d. 1754),
and Adam Öhlenschläger (d. 1850), the former by Stein and the
latter by H. V. Bissen, stand on either side of the entrance, and
the front is crowned by a group by King, representing Apollo
and Pegasus, and the Fountain of Hippocrene. Within, among
other sculptures, is a relief figure of Ophelia, executed by Sarah
Bernhardt. Other buildings in Kongens Nytorv are the foreign
office, several great commercial houses, the commercial bank,
and the Thotts Palais of c. 1685. The quays of the Nyhavn are
lined with old gabled houses.</p>

<p>From the south end of Kongens Nytorv, a street called
Holmens Kanal winds past the National Bank to the Holmens
Kirke, or church for the royal navy, originally erected as an
anchor-smithy by Frederick II., but consecrated by Christian
IV., with a chapel containing the tombs of the great admirals
Niels Juel and Peder Tordenskjöld, and wood-carving of the
17th century. The street then crosses a bridge on to the
Slottsholm, an island divided from the mainland by a narrow
arm of the harbour, occupied mainly by the Christiansborg
and adjacent buildings. The royal palace of Christiansborg,
originally built (1731-1745) by Christian VI., destroyed by
fire in 1794, and rebuilt, again fell in flames in 1884. Fortunately
most of the art treasures which the palace contained were saved.
A decision was arrived at in 1903, in commemoration of the
jubilee of the reign of Christian IX., to rebuild the palace for
use on occasions of state, and to house the parliament. On the
Slottsplads (Palace Square) which faces east, is an equestrian
statue of Frederick VII. There are also preserved the bronze
statues which stood over the portal of the palace before the fire&mdash;figures
of Strength, Wisdom, Health and Justice, designed by
Thorvaldsen. The palace chapel, adorned with works by
Thorvaldsen and Bissen, was preserved from the fire, as was
the royal library of about 540,000 volumes and 20,000 manuscripts,
for which a new building in Christiansgade was designed
about 1900.</p>

<p>The exchange (<i>Börsen</i>), on the quay to the east, is an ornate
gabled building erected in 1619-1640, surmounted by a remarkable
spire, formed of four dragons, with their heads directed to
the four points of the compass, and their bodies entwining each
other till their tails come to a point at the top. To the south
is the arsenal (<i>Töjhus</i>) with a collection of ancient armour.</p>

<p>The Thorvaldsen museum (1839-1848), a sombre building
in a combination of the Egyptian and Etruscan styles, consists
of two storeys. In the centre is an open court, containing the
artist&rsquo;s tomb. The exterior walls are decorated with groups
of figures of coloured stucco, illustrative of events connected
with Thorvaldsen&rsquo;s life. Over the principal entrance is the
chariot of Victory drawn by four horses, executed in bronze
from a model by Bissen. The front hall, corridors and apartments
are painted in the Pompeian style, with brilliant colours
and with great artistic skill. The museum contains about 300
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
of Thorvaldsen&rsquo;s works; and in one apartment is his sitting-room
furniture arranged as it was found at the time of his death in
1844.</p>

<p>On the mainland, immediately west of the Slottsholm, is the
Prinsens Palais, once the residence of Christian V. and Frederick
VI. when crown princes, containing the national museum. This
consists of four sections, the Danish, ethnographical, antique
and numismatic. It was founded in 1807 by Professor Nyerup,
and extended between 1815 and 1885 by C. J. Thomsen and
J. J. A. Worsaae, and the ethnographical collection is among
the finest in the world. From this point the Raadhusgade leads
north-west to the combined Nytorv-og-Gammeltorv, where is
the old townhall (<i>Raadhus</i>, 1815), and continues as the Nörregade
to the Vor Frue Kirke (Church of our Lady), the cathedral
church of Copenhagen. This church, the site of which has been
similarly occupied since the 12th century, was almost entirely
destroyed in the bombardment of 1807, but was completely
restored in 1811-1829. The works of Thorvaldsen which it
contains constitute its chief attraction. In the pediment is a
group of sixteen figures by Thorvaldsen, representing John the
Baptist preaching in the wilderness; over the entrance within
the portico is a bas-relief of Christ&rsquo;s entry into Jerusalem; on
one side of the entrance is a statue of Moses by Bissen, and on
the other a statue of David by Jerichau. In a niche behind
the altar stands a colossal marble statue of Christ, and
marble statues of the twelve apostles adorn both sides of the
church.</p>

<p>Immediately north of Vor Frue Kirke is the university,
founded by Christian I. in 1479; though its existing constitution
dates from 1788. The building dates from 1836. There are five
faculties&mdash;theological, juridical, medical, philosophical and
mathematical. In 1851 an English and in 1852 an Anglo-Saxon
lectureship were established. All the professors are bound to give
a series of lectures open to the public free of charge. The
university possesses considerable endowments and has several
foundations for the assistance of poor students; the &ldquo;regent&rsquo;s
charity,&rdquo; for instance, founded by Christian, affords free residence
and a small allowance to one hundred bursars. There are about
2000 students. In connexion with the university are the observatory,
the chemical laboratory in Ny Vester Gade, the surgical
academy in Bredgade, founded in 1786, and the botanic garden.
The university library, incorporated with the former Classen
library, collected by the famous merchants of that name, contains
about 200,000 volumes, besides about 4000 manuscripts, which
include Rask&rsquo;s valuable Oriental collection and the Arne-Magnean
series of Scandinavian documents. It shares with the royal
library the right of receiving a copy of every book published in
Denmark. There is also a zoological museum. Adjacent is
St Peter&rsquo;s church, built in a quasi-Gothic style, with a spire
256 ft. high, and appropriated since 1585 as a parish church for
the German residents in Copenhagen. A short distance along
the Krystalgade is Trinity church. Its round tower is 111 ft.
high, and is considered to be unique in Europe. It was constructed
from a plan of Tycho Brahe&rsquo;s favourite disciple Longomontanus,
and was formerly used as an observatory. It is
ascended by a broad inclined spiral way, up which Peter the
Great is said to have driven in a carriage and four. From this
church the Kjöbermayergade runs south, a populous street of
shops, giving upon the Höibro-plads, with its fine equestrian
statue of Bishop Absalon, the city&rsquo;s founder. This square is
connected by a bridge with the Slottsholm.</p>

<p>The quarter north-east of Kongens Nytorv and Gothersgaden
is the richest in the city, including the palaces of Amalienborg,
the castle and gardens of Rosenborg and several mansions of the
nobility. The quarter extends to the strong moated citadel,
which guards the harbour on the north-east. It is a regular
polygon with five bastions, founded by Frederick III. about
1662-1663. One of the mansions, the Moltkes Palais, has a
collection of Dutch paintings formed in the 18th century. This
is in the principal thoroughfare of the quarter, Bredgaden, and
close at hand the palace of King George of Greece faces the
Frederikskirke or Marble church. This church, intended to have
been an edifice of great extent and magnificence, was begun in
the reign of Frederick V. (1749), but after twenty years was left
unfinished. It remained a ruin until 1874, when it was purchased
by a wealthy banker, M. Tietgen, at whose expense the work
was resumed. The edifice was not carried up to the height
originally intended, but the magnificent dome, which recalls the
finest examples in Italy, is conspicuous far and wide. The
diameter is only a few feet less than that of St Peter&rsquo;s in Rome.
As the church stands it is one of the principal works of the
architect, F. Meldahl. Behind King George&rsquo;s palace from the
Bredgade lies the Amalienborg-plads, having in the centre an
equestrian statue of Frederick V., erected in 1768 at the cost of
the former Asiatic Company. The four palaces, of uniform
design, encircling this <i>plads</i>, were built for the residence
of four noble families; but on the destruction of Christiansborg
in 1794 they became the residence of the king and
court, and so continued till the death of Christian VIII. in
1848. One of the four is inhabited by the king, the second and
third by the crown prince and other members of the royal family,
while the fourth is occupied by the coronation and state rooms.
The Ameliegade crosses the <i>plads</i> and, with the Bredgade,
terminates at the esplanade outside the citadel, prolonged in the
pleasant promenade of Lange Linie skirting the Sound.</p>

<p>To the west of the citadel is the Ostbanegaard, or eastern railway
station, from which start the local trains on the coast line
to Klampenborg and Helsingör. South-west from this point
extends the line of gardens which occupy the site of former landward
fortifications, pleasantly diversified by water and plantations,
skirted on the inner side by three wide boulevards,
Östervold, Nörrevold and Vestervold Gade, and containing
noteworthy public buildings, mostly modern. In the Östre
Anlaeg is the art museum (1895) containing pictures, sculptures
and engravings. In front of it is the Denmark monument (1896),
commemorating the golden wedding (1892) of Christian IX.
and Queen Louisa. Among various scenes in relief, the marriage
of King Edward VII. of England and Queen Alexandra is
depicted. The botanical garden (1874) contains an observatory
with a statue of Tycho Brahe, and the chemical laboratory,
mineralogical museum, polytechnic academy (1829) and communal
hospital adjoin it. On the inner side of Östevold Gade
is Rosenborg Park, with the palace of Rosenborg erected in
1610-1617. It is an irregular building in Gothic style, with a
high pointed roof, and flanked by four towers of unequal dimensions.
It contains the chronological collection of Danish
monarchs, including a coin and medal cabinet, a fine collection
of Venetian glass, the famous silver drinking-horn of Oldenburg
(1474), the regalia and other objects of interest as illustrating
the history of Denmark. The Riddersal, a spacious room, is
covered with tapestry representing the various battles of
Christian V., and has at one end a massive silver throne. The
Nörrevold Gade leads through the Nörretorv past the Folke-teatre
and the technical school to the Örsteds park, and from
its southern end the Vestervold Gade continues through the
Raadhus Plads, a centre of tramways, flanked by the modern
Renaissance town hall (1901), ornamented with bronze figures,
with a tower at the eastern angle. Here is also the museum
of industrial art, and the Ny-Carlsberg Glyptotek, with its
collection of sculpture, is on this boulevard, which skirts the
pleasure garden called Tivoli. From the Raadhus-plads the
Vesterbro Gade runs towards the western quarter of the city,
skirting the Tivoli. Here is the Dansk Folke museum, a collection
illustrating the domestic life of the nation, particularly that
of the peasantry since 1600. A column of Liberty (<i>Friheds-Stötte</i>)
rises in an open space, erected in 1798 to commemorate
the abolition of serfdom. Immediately north is the main
railway station (<i>Banegaard</i>), and the North and Klampenborg
stations near at hand. The western (residential) quarter contains
the park of Frederiksberg, with its palace erected under Frederick
IV. (d. 1730), used as a military school. The park contains a
zoological garden, and is continued south in the pleasant Söndermarken,
near which lies the old Glyptotek, which contained the
splendid collection of sculptures, &amp;c., made by H. C. Jacobsen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
since 1887, until their removal to the new Glyptotek founded
by him in the Vestre Boulevard.</p>

<p>The quarter of Christianshavn is that portion of the city which
skirts the harbour to the south, and lies within the fortifications.
It contains the Vor Frelsers Kirke (Church of Our Saviour),
dedicated in 1696, with a curious steeple 282 ft. high, ascended
by an external spiral staircase. The lower part of the altar is
composed of Italian marble, with a representation of Christ&rsquo;s
sufferings in the garden of Gethsemane; and the organ is considered
the finest in Copenhagen. The city does not extend
much farther south, though the Amagerbro quarter lies without
the walls. The island of Amager is fertile, producing vegetables
for the markets of the capital. It was peopled by a Dutch colony
planted by Christian II. in 1516, and many old peculiarities of
dress, manners and languages are retained.</p>

<p>The environs of Copenhagen to the north and west are interesting,
and the country, both along the coast northward and inland
westward is pleasant, though in no way remarkable. The railway
along the coast northward passes the seaside resorts of
Klampenborg (6 m.) and Skodsborg (10 m.). Near Klampenborg
is the Dyrehave (Deer park) or Skoven (the forest), a beautiful
forest of beeches. The Zealand Northern railway passes Lyngby,
on the lake of the same name, a favourite summer residence, and
Hilleröd (21 m.), a considerable town, capital of the <i>amt</i> (county)
of Frederiksberg, and close to the palace of Frederiksberg.
This was erected in 1602-1620 by Christian IV., embodying two
towers of an earlier building, and partly occupying islands in a
small lake. It suffered seriously from fire in 1859, but was carefully
restored under the direction of F. Meldahl. It contains a
national historical museum, including furniture and pictures.
The palace church is an interesting medley of Gothic and Renaissance
detail. The villa of Hvidöre was acquired by Queen
Alexandra in 1907.</p>

<p>Among the literary and scientific associations of Copenhagen
may be mentioned the Danish Royal Society, founded in 1742,
for the advancement of the sciences of mathematics, astronomy,
natural philosophy, &amp;c., by the publication of papers and essays;
the Royal Antiquarian Society, founded in 1825, for diffusing
a knowledge of Northern and Icelandic archaeology; the Society
for the Promotion of Danish Literature, for the publication of
works chiefly connected with the history of Danish literature;
the Natural Philosophy Society; the Royal Agricultural Society;
the Danish Church History Society; the Industrial Association,
founded in 1838; the Royal Geographical Society, established
in 1876; and several musical and other societies. The Academy
of Arts was founded by Frederick V. in 1754 for the instruction
of artists, and for disseminating a taste for the fine arts among
manufacturers and operatives. Attached to it are schools for
the study of architecture, ornamental drawing and modelling.
An Art Union was founded in 1826, and a musical conservatorium
in 1870 under the direction of the composers N. W. Gade and
J. P. E. Hartmann.</p>

<p>Among educational institutions, other than the university,
may be mentioned the veterinary and agricultural college,
established in 1773 and adopted by the state in 1776, the
military academy and the school of navigation. Technical
instruction is provided by the polytechnic school (1829), which
is a state institution, and the school of the Technical Society,
which, though a private foundation, enjoys public subvention.
The schools which prepare for the university, &amp;c., are nearly all
private, but are all under the control of the state. Elementary
instruction is mostly provided by the communal schools.</p>

<p>The churches already mentioned belong to the national
Lutheran Church; the most important of those belonging to
other denominations are the Reformed church, founded in 1688,
and rebuilt in 1731, the Catholic church of St Ansgarius, consecrated
in 1842, and the Jewish synagogue in Krystalgade,
which dates from 1853. Of the monastic buildings of medieval
Copenhagen various traces are preserved in the present nomenclature
of the streets. The Franciscan establishment gives its
name to the Graabrödretorv or Grey Friars&rsquo; market; and
St Clara&rsquo;s Monastery, the largest of all, which was founded by
Queen Christina, is still commemorated by the Klareboder or
Clara buildings, near the present post-office. The Duebrödre
Kloster occupied the site of the hospital of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Among the hospitals of Copenhagen, besides many modern
institutions, there may be mentioned Frederick&rsquo;s hospital,
erected in 1752-1757 by Frederick V., the Communal Hospital,
erected in 1859-1863, on the eastern side of the Sortedamssö,
the general hospital in Ameliegade, founded in 1769, and the
garrison hospital, in Rigensgade, established in 1816 by Frederick
VI. After the cholera epidemic of 1853, which carried off more
than 4000 of the inhabitants, the medical association built
several ranges of workmen&rsquo;s houses, and their example was
followed by various private capitalists, among whom may be
mentioned the Classen trustees, whose buildings occupy an open
site on the western outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>Copenhagen is by far the most important commercial town
in Denmark, and exemplifies the steady increase in the trade
of the country. The harbour is mainly comprised in the narrow
strait between the outer Sound and its inlet the Kalvebod or
Kallebo Strand. The trading capabilities were aided by the
construction in 1894 of the Frihavn (free port) at the northern
extremity of the town, well supplied with warehouses and other
conveniences. It is connected with the main railway station by
means of a circular railway, while a short branch connects it
with the ordinary custom-house quay. The commercial harbour
is separated from the harbour for warships (<i>Orlogshavn</i>) by a
barrier. The sea approaches are guarded by ten coast batteries
besides the old citadel. The Middelgrund is a powerful defensive
work completed in 1896 and most of the rest are modern. The
landward defences of Copenhagen, it may be added, were left
unprovided for after the Napoleonic wars until the patriotism of
Danish women, who subscribed sufficient funds for the first fort,
shamed parliament into granting the necessary money for others
(1886-1895). Copenhagen is not an industrial town. The
manufactures carried on are mostly only such as exist in every
large town, and the export of manufactured goods is inconsiderable.
The royal china factory is celebrated for models of
Thorvaldsen&rsquo;s works in biscuit china. The only very large
establishment is one for the construction of iron steamers,
engines, &amp;c., but some factories have been erected within the area
of the free port for the purpose of working up imported raw
materials duty free.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Copenhagen (<i>i.e.</i> Merchant&rsquo;s Harbour, originally
simply Havn, latinized as <i>Hafnia</i>) is first mentioned in history
in 1043. It was then only a fishing village, and remained so
until about the middle of the 12th century, when Valdemar I.
presented that part of the island to Axel Hvide, renowned in
Danish history as Absalon (<i>q.v.</i>), bishop of Roskilde, and afterwards
archbishop of Lund. In 1167 this prelate erected a castle
on the spot where the Christiansborg palace now stands, and
the building was called after him Axel-huus. The settlement
gradually became a great resort for merchants, and thus acquired
the name which, in a corrupted form, it still bears, of Kaupmannahöfn,
Kjöbmannshavn, or <i>Portus Mercatorum</i> as it is
translated by Saxo Grammaticus. In 1186, Bishop Absalon
bestowed the castle and village, with the lands of Amager, on
the see of Roskilde; but, as the place grew in importance, the
Danish kings became anxious to regain it, and in 1245 King
Eric IV. drove out Bishop Niels Stigson. On the king&rsquo;s death
(1250), however, Bishop Jacob Erlandsen obtained the town,
and, in 1254, gave to the burghers their first municipal privileges,
which were confirmed by Pope Urban III. in 1286. In the
charter of 1254, while there is mention of a <i>communitas</i> capable
of making a compact with the bishop, there is nothing said of
any trade or craft gilds. These are, indeed, expressly prohibited
in the later charter of Bishop Johann Kvag (1294);
and the distinctive character of the constitution of Copenhagen
during the middle ages consisted in the absence of the free gild
system, and the right of any burgher to pursue a craft under
license from the <i>Vogt</i> (<i>advocatus</i>) of the overlord and the city
authorities. Later on, gilds were established, in spite of the prohibition
of the old charters; but they were strictly subordinate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
to the town authorities, who appointed their aldermen and suppressed
them when they considered them useless or dangerous.
The prosperity of Copenhagen was checked by an attack by the
people of Lübeck in 1248, and by another on the part of Prince
Jaromir of Rügen in 1259. In 1306 it managed to repel the
Norwegians, but in 1362, and again in 1368, it was captured
by the opponents of Valdemar Atterdag. In the following
century a new enemy appeared in the Hanseatic league, which
was jealous of its rivalry, but their invasion was frustrated by
Queen Philippa. Various attempts were made by successive
kings to obtain the town from the see of Roskilde, as the most
suitable for the royal residence; but it was not till 1443 that the
transference was finally effected and Copenhagen became the
capital of the kingdom. From 1523 to 1524 it held out for
Christian II. against Frederick I., who captured it at length and
strengthened its defensive works; and it was only after a year&rsquo;s
siege that it yielded in 1536 to Christian III. From 1658 to 1660
it was unsuccessfully beleaguered by Charles Gustavus of Sweden;
and in the following year it was rewarded by various privileges
for its gallant defence. In 1660 it gave its name to the treaty
which concluded the Swedish war of Frederick III. In 1700 it
was bombarded by the united fleets of England, Holland and
Sweden; in 1728 a conflagration destroyed 1640 houses and
five churches; another in 1795 laid waste 943 houses, the church
of St Nicolas, and the <i>Raadhus</i>. In 1801 the Danish fleet was
destroyed in the roadstead by the English (see below, § <i>Battle
of Copenhagen</i>); and in 1807 the city was bombarded by the
British under Lord Cathcart, and saw the destruction of the
university buildings, its principal church and numerous other
edifices.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><span class="sc">Battle of Copenhagen</span></p>

<p>The formation of a league between the northern powers,
Russia, Prussia, Denmark and Sweden, on the 16th of December
1800, nominally to protect neutral trade at sea from the enforcement
by Great Britain of her belligerent claims, led to the
despatch of a British fleet to the Baltic on the 12th of March
1801. It consisted of fifty-three sail in all, of which eighteen
were of the line. Prussia possessed no fleet. The nominal
strength of the Russian fleet was eighty-three sail of the line,
of the Danish twenty-three, and of the Swedish eighteen. But
this force was for the most part only on paper. Some of the
Russian ships were at Archangel, others in the Mediterranean.
Of those actually in the Baltic and fit to go to sea, twelve were
at Reval shut in by the ice, and the others were at Kronstadt.
The Swedes could equip only eleven of the line for sea, and
Denmark only seven or eight. It is highly doubtful whether
the three powers could have collected more than forty ships of
the line&mdash;and they would have been hastily manned, destitute
of experience, and without confidence. A rapid British attack
would in any case forestall the concentration of these heterogeneous
squadrons. The superior quality of the veteran British
crews was more than enough to counterbalance a mere superiority
in numbers. The command of the British fleet was given to
Sir Hyde Parker, an amiable man of no energy and little ability.
He had Nelson with him as second in command&mdash;then a junior
admiral but without rival in capacity and in his hold on the
confidence of the fleet. Parker&rsquo;s orders were to give Denmark
twenty-four hours in which to withdraw from the coalition, and
on her refusal to destroy or neutralize her strength and then
proceed against the Russians before the breaking up of the ice
allowed the ships at Reval to join the squadron at Kronstadt.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March the British fleet, after a somewhat
stormy passage, was at the entrance to the Sound. Nicholas
Vansittart, afterwards Lord Bexley, the British diplomatic
agent entrusted with the message to the Danish government,
was landed, and left for Copenhagen. On the 23rd he returned
with the refusal of the Danes. The British fleet then passed
the Danish fort at Cronenburg, unhurt by its distant fire, and
without being molested by the forts on the Swedish shore.
Nelson urged immediate attack, and recommended, as an
alternative, that part of the British fleet should watch the Danes
while the remainder advanced up the Baltic to prevent the
junction of the Russian Reval squadron with the ships in
Kronstadt. Sir Hyde Parker was, however, unwilling to go up the
Baltic with the Danes unsubdued behind him, or to divide his
force. It was therefore resolved that an attack should be made
on the Danish capital with the whole fleet in two divisions.
Copenhagen lies on the east side of the island of Zealand; opposite
it is the shoal known as the Middle Ground. To the east of the
Middle Ground is another shoal known as Saltholm Flat, and
there is a passage available for large ships between them. The
main fortification of Copenhagen was the powerful Trekroner
(Three Crown) battery at the northern end of the sea-front.
Here the Danes had placed their strongest ships. The southern
part of the city front was covered by hulks and gun-vessels or
bomb-vessels. There were in all eighteen hulks or ships of the
line in the Danish defence. To have made the attack from the
northern end would in Nelson&rsquo;s words have been &ldquo;to take the
bull by the horns.&rdquo; He therefore proposed that he should be
detached with ten sail of the line, and the frigates and small
craft, to pass between the Middle Ground and Saltholm Flat,
and assail the Danish line at the southern end while the remainder
of the fleet engaged the Trekroner battery from the north. Sir
Hyde Parker accepted his offer, and added two ships of the line
to the ten asked for by Nelson.</p>

<p>During the nights of the 30th and 31st of March the channel
between the Middle Ground and Saltholm Flat was sounded
by the boats of the British fleet, the Danes making no attempt
to interfere with them. On the 1st of April Nelson brought his
ships through. He had transferred his flag from his own ship
the &ldquo;St George&rdquo; (98) to the &ldquo;Elephant&rdquo; (74), commanded by
Captain Foley, because the water was too shallow for a three-decker.
On the morning of the 2nd of April the wind was fair
from the south-east, and at 9.30 A.M. the British squadron weighed
anchor, led by the &ldquo;Amazon&rdquo; frigate, commanded by Captain
Riou, and began to pass along the front of the Danish line. The
Danes could bring into action 375 guns in all. Their hulks and
bomb-vessels were supported by batteries on Zealand; but, as
the water is shallow for a long distance from the shore, these
defences were too far off to render them effectual aid on the
south end of their line. Nelson disposed of a greater number
of guns, 1058 in all, but some did not come into action. The
&ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo; (64), commanded by Captain Fancourt, was
unable to round the south point of the Middle Ground. The
&ldquo;Bellona&rdquo; (74), commanded by Captain Thompson, and the
&ldquo;Russel&rdquo; (74), commanded by Captain Cuming, ran ashore
on the Middle Ground, but within range though at too great a
distance for fully effective fire. Captain Thompson lost his leg
in the battle. The other ships passed between the &ldquo;Bellona&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Russel&rdquo; and the Danes. The leading British ship, the
&ldquo;Defiance&rdquo; (74), carrying the flag of Rear-Admiral Graves,
anchored just south of the Trekroner. As the wind was from
the south-east Sir Hyde Parker was unable to make the proposed
attack from the north. The place opposite the Danish fort
which was to have been taken by him was occupied by Captain
Riou and the frigates. The &ldquo;Elephant&rdquo; anchored almost in
the middle of the line. Fire was opened about 10 A.M., and at
11.30 the action was at its height.</p>

<p>Until 1 o&rsquo;clock there was no diminution of the Danish fire.
Sir Hyde Parker, who saw the danger of Nelson&rsquo;s position,
became anxious, and sent his second, Captain Robert Waller
Ottway, to him with a message authorizing him to retire if he
thought fit. Before Ottway, who had to go in a row-boat, reached
the &ldquo;Elephant,&rdquo; Sir Hyde Parker had reflected that it would be
more magnanimous in him to take the responsibility of ordering
the retreat. He therefore hoisted the signal of recall. It was
a well-meant but ill-judged order. Nelson could only have
retreated before the south-easterly wind by going past the
Trekroner fort, where the passage is narrow, and the navigation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
difficult. He therefore disregarded the signal, and amused
himself and the few officers about him by putting his glass to
his blind eye and saying that he could not see it. The frigates
opposite the Trekroner did retreat, Captain Riou being slain
as they drew off.</p>

<p>At about 2.30 the fire from the Danish hulks had been much
beaten down, but as their crews fell, fresh men were sent from
the shore and the fire was resumed. Nelson astutely and
legitimately seized the opportunity to open negotiations with the
Danes. He sent a flag of truce carried by Sir F. Thesiger ashore
to the crown prince of Denmark (then regent of the kingdom),
to say that unless he was allowed to take possession of the hulks
which had surrendered he would be compelled to burn them, a
course which he deprecated on the ground of humanity and his
tenderness of &ldquo;the brothers of the English the Danes.&rdquo; The
crown prince, who was shaken by the spectacle of the battle,
allowed himself to be drawn into a reply, and to be referred to
Sir Hyde Parker. Fire was suspended by the Danes to allow
of time to receive Sir Hyde Parker&rsquo;s answer. Nelson with
intelligent promptitude availed himself of the interval to withdraw
his squadron past the Trekroner. The difficulty found in
getting the ships out&mdash;one of them grounded&mdash;showed how
disastrous an attempt to draw off under fire of the forts must
have been.</p>

<p>The Danish government, which had entered the coalition
largely from fear of Russia, was not prepared to make very great
sacrifices, and now entered into negotiations for an armistice.
It was the more ready to do so because it received news of the
assassination of the tsar Paul, which had happened on the 24th
of March. An armistice was made for fourteen weeks, which
left the British fleet free to proceed up the Baltic. On the 12th
of April, after lightening the three-deckers of their guns, the
fleet passed over the shallows. But its presence had now lost
all military significance. Sir Hyde Parker was assured by the
Russian minister at Copenhagen that the new tsar Alexander I.
would not continue the policy of hostility with England and
alliance with France which had proved fatal to his father. The
Swedes, who like the Danes had entered the coalition under
pressure from Russia, did not send their ships to sea. The
government of the new tsar was prepared for an arrangement
with England. The date of the final settlement was in all
probability delayed by the activity of Nelson, and his belief that
a British fleet was the best negotiator in Europe. The British
government learnt of the tsar&rsquo;s death on the 15th of April. On
the 17th it instructed Sir Hyde Parker to agree to a suspension of
hostilities, and not to take active measures against Russia so long
as the Reval squadron did not put to sea. On the 21st of April,
having now received a full account of the battle at Copenhagen,
it recalled Sir Hyde Parker, whose vacillating conduct and
want of enterprise had become manifest. He received the news
of his recall on the 5th of May. Nelson, to whom the command
passed, at once put to sea, and hastened with a part of his fleet
to Reval, which he reached on the 12th of May. The Russian
squadron had, however, cut a passage through the ice in the
harbour on the 3rd, and had sailed for Kronstadt. Nelson was
received with formal civility by the Russian officers, with whom
he exchanged visits. He wrote a letter to Mr Garlike, secretary
of the British embassy at St Petersburg, saying that he had come
with a small squadron as the best way of paying &ldquo;the very
highest compliment&rdquo; to the tsar.</p>

<p>The Russian government, which not unnaturally wished to
avoid any appearance of acting under dictation, and was now
in no anxiety for the Reval squadron, treated his presence as a
menace. On the 13th of May Count Pahlen answered in a most
peremptory letter informing Nelson that negotiations would
be suspended while he remained at Reval. This retort caused
Nelson annoyance which he did not attempt to conceal, but he
justly concluded that he had nothing further to do at Reval,
and therefore returned down the Baltic. Nelson remained with
the fleet till he was relieved at his own request, and was able to
sail for England on the 18th of June. He gave a proof of his
regard for the service of the country by taking his passage home
in a small brig rather than withdraw a line of battle ship from the
squadron, which his rank entitled him to do, and as other
admirals of the time generally did. The British sailors and ships
embargoed in Russia were released on the 17th of May. Great
Britain released her prisoners on the 4th of June, and on the
17th of June was signed the convention which terminated the
Baltic campaign.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPERNICUS<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Koppernigk</span>), <span class="bold">NICOLAUS</span> (1473-1543), Polish
astronomer, was born on the 19th of February 1473, at Thorn
in Prussian Poland, where his father, a native of Cracow, had
settled as a wholesale trader. His mother, Barbara Watzelrode,
belonged to a family of high mercantile and civic standing.
After the death of his father in 1483, Nicolaus was virtually
adopted by his uncle Lucas Watzelrode, later (in 1489) bishop
of Ermeland. Placed at the university of Cracow in 1491, he
devoted himself, during three years, to mathematical science
under Albert Brudzewski (1445-1497), and incidentally acquired
some skill in painting. At the age of twenty-three he repaired
to Bologna, and there varied his studies of canon law by attending
the astronomical lectures of Domenico Maria Novara (1454-1504).
At Rome, in the Jubilee year 1500, he himself lectured
with applause; but having been nominated in 1497 canon of
the cathedral of Frauenburg, he recrossed the Alps in 1501 with
the purpose of obtaining further leave of absence for the completion
of his academic career. Late in the same year, accordingly,
he entered the medical school of Padua, where he remained
until 1505, having taken meanwhile a doctor&rsquo;s degree in canon
law at Ferrara on the 31st of May 1503. After his return to
his native country he resided at the episcopal palace of Heilsberg
as his uncle&rsquo;s physician until the latter&rsquo;s death on the 29th of
March 1512. He then retired to Frauenburg, and vigorously
attended to his capitular duties. He never took orders, but
acted continually as the representative of the chapter under
harassing conditions, administrative and political; he was
besides commissary of the diocese of Ermeland; his medical
skill, always at the service of the poor, was frequently in demand
by the rich; and he laid a scheme for the reform of the currency
before the Diet of Graudenz in 1522. Yet he found time, amid
these multifarious occupations, to elaborate an entirely new
system of astronomy, by the adoption of which man&rsquo;s outlook
on the universe was fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>The main lines of his great work were laid down at Heilsberg;
at Frauenburg, from 1513, he sought, with scanty instrumental
means, to test by observation the truth of the views it embodied
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Astronomy</a></span>: <i>History</i>). His dissatisfaction with Ptolemaic
doctrines was of early date; and he returned from Italy, where
so-called Pythagorean opinions were then freely discussed, in
strong and irrevocable possession of the heliocentric theory.
The epoch-making treatise in which it was set forth, virtually
finished in 1530, began to be known through the circulation in
manuscript of a <i>Commentariolus</i>, or brief popular account of its
purport written by Copernicus in that year. Johann Albrecht
Widmanstadt lectured upon it in Rome; Clement VII. approved,
and Cardinal Schönberg transmitted to the author a formal
demand for full publication. But his assent to this was only
extracted from him in 1540 by the importunities of his friends,
especially of his enthusiastic disciple George Joachim Rheticus
(1514-1576), who printed, in the <i>Narratio prima</i> (Danzig, 1540),
a preliminary account of the Copernican theory, and simultaneously
sent to the press at Nuremberg his master&rsquo;s complete
exposition of it in the treatise entitled <i>De revolutionibus orbium
coelestium</i> (1543). But the first printed copy reached Frauenburg
barely in time to be laid on the writer&rsquo;s death-bed. Copernicus
was seized with apoplexy and paralysis towards the close
of 1542, and died on the 24th of May 1543, happily unconscious
that the fine Epistle, in which he had dedicated his life&rsquo;s work
to Paul III., was marred of its effect by an anonymous preface,
slipt in by Andreas Osiander (1498-1552), with a view to disarming
prejudice by insisting upon the purely hypothetical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
character of the reasonings it introduced. The trigonometrical
section of the book had been issued as a separate treatise (Wittenberg,
1542) under the care of Rheticus. The only work published
by Copernicus on his own initiative was a Latin version of the
Greek Epistles of Theophylact (Cracow, 1509). His treatise
<i>De monetae cudendae ratione</i>, 1526 (first printed in 1816), written
by order of King Sigismund I., is an exposition of the principles
on which it was proposed to reform the currency of the Prussian
provinces of Poland. It advocates unity of the monetary system
throughout the entire state, with strict integrity in the quality
of the coin, and the charge of a seigniorage sufficient to cover
the expenses of mintage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;Rheticus was the only contemporary biographer
of Copernicus, and his narrative perished irretrievably. Gassendi&rsquo;s
jejune Life (Paris, 1654) is thus the earliest extant of any note.
It was supplemented, during the 19th century, by the various
publications of J. Sniadecki (Warsaw, 1803-1818); of J. H. W.
Westphal, J. Czynski, M. Curtze, H. A. Wolynski, F. Hipler, and
others, but their efforts were overshadowed by Dr Leopold Prowe&rsquo;s
exhaustive <i>Nicolaus Coppernicus</i> (Berlin, 1883-1884), embodying
the outcome of researches indefatigably prosecuted for over thirty
years. The first volume (in two parts) is a detailed biography of the
great astronomer; the second includes some of his minor writings
and correspondence, family records, and historical documents of
local interest. The effects of his Italian sojourn upon the nascent
ideas of Copernicus may be profitably studied in Domenico Berti&rsquo;s
<i>Copernico e le vicende del sistema Copernicano in Italia</i> (Roma, 1876),
and in G. V. Schiaparelli&rsquo;s <i>I Precursori del Copernico nell&rsquo; antichità</i>
(Milano, 1873). A centenary edition of <i>De revolutionibus orbium
coelestium</i> was issued at Thorn in 1873, and a German translation
by C. L. Menzzer in 1879.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPIAPÓ,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a city of northern Chile, capital of the province of
Atacama, about 35 m. from the coast on the Copiapó river, in
lat. 27° 36&prime; S., long. 70° 23&prime; W. Pop. (1895) 9301. The Caldera
&amp; Copiapó railway (built 1848-1851 and one of the first in South
America) extends beyond Copiapó to the Chañarcillo mines
(50 m.) and other mining districts. Copiapó stands 1300 ft.
above sea-level and has a mean temperature of about 67° in
summer and 51° in winter. Its port, Caldera, 50 m. distant by
rail, is situated on a well-sheltered bay with good shipping
facilities about 6 m. N. of the mouth of the Copiapó river.
Copiapó is perhaps the best built and most attractive of the
desert region cities. The river brings down from the mountains
enough water to supply the town and irrigate a considerable
area in its vicinity. Beyond the small fertile valley in which
it stands is the barren desert, on which rain rarely falls and
which has no economic value apart from its minerals (especially
saline compounds). Copiapó was founded in 1742 by José de
Manso (afterwards Conde de Superunda, viceroy of Peru) and
took its name from the Copayapu Indians who occupied that
region. It was primarily a military station and transport post
on the road to Peru, but after the discovery of the rich silver
deposits near Chañarcillo by Juan Godoy in 1832 it became an
important mining centre. It has a good mining school and
reduction works, and is the supply station for an extensive
mining district. For many years the Famatina mines of
Argentina received supplies from this point by way of the Come-Caballo
pass.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPING<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (from &ldquo;cope,&rdquo; Lat. <i>capa</i>), in architecture, the capping
or covering of a wall. This may be made of stone, brick, tile,
slate, metal, wood or thatch. In all cases it should be weathered
to throw off the wet. In Romanesque work it was plain and
flat, and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip.
In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering (mainly
on the outer side), and began at the top with an astragal; in
the Decorated style there were two or three sets off; and in the
later Perpendicular period these assumed a wavy section, and
the coping mouldings were continued round the sides, as well
as at top and bottom, mitreing at the angles, as in many of the
colleges at Oxford. The cheapest type of coping is that which
caps the ordinary 9 in. brick wall, and consists of brick on edge
above a double tile creasing, all in cement; the creasing consisting
of one or two rows of tiles laid horizontally on the wall
and projecting on each side about 2 in. to throw off the water

worked for Wynkyn de Worde. The first book to which his
name is affixed as a printer is <i>The Boke of Justices of Peace</i> (1515),
at the sign of the Rose Garland, in Fleet Street, London. Anthony
à Wood supposed, on the ground that he was more educated
than was usual in his trade, that he had been a poor scholar of
Oxford. His best known works are <i>The hye way to the Spyttell

St Bartholomew&rsquo;s hospital, containing much information about
the vagabonds who found their way there; and <i>Jyl of Breyntfords

&ldquo;a poem devoid of wit or decency, and totally unworthy of

of <i>Kynge Appolyne of Thyre</i> (W. de Worde, 1510), <i>The History
of Helyas Knyght of the Swanne</i> (W. de Worde, 1513), and <i>The

other works is <i>The Complaynte of them that ben too late maryed</i>,
an undated tract printed by W. de Worde.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPLESTON, EDWARD<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (1776-1849), English bishop, was
born at Offwell in Devonshire, and educated at Oxford. He was
elected to a tutorship at Oriel College in 1797, and in 1800 was
appointed vicar of St Mary&rsquo;s, Oxford. As university professor
of poetry (1802-1812) he gained a considerable reputation by
his clever literary criticism and sound latinity. After holding
the office of dean at Oriel for some years, he succeeded to the
provostship in 1814, and owing largely to his influence the
college reached a remarkable degree of prosperity during the
first quarter of the 19th century. In 1826 he was appointed
dean of Chester, and in the next year he was consecrated bishop
of Llandaff. Here he gave his support to the new movement
for church restoration in Wales, and during his occupation of
the see more than twenty new churches were built in the diocese.
The political problems of the time interested him greatly, and
his writings include two able letters to Sir Robert Peel, one
dealing with the <i>Variable Standard of Value</i>, the other with the
<i>Increase of Pauperism</i> (Oxford, 1819).</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPLEY, JOHN SINGLETON<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1737-1815), English historical
painter, was born of Irish parents at Boston, Massachusetts.
He was self-educated, and commenced his career as a portrait-painter
in his native city. The germ of his reputation in England
was a little picture of a boy and squirrel, exhibited at the Society
of Arts in 1760. In 1774 he went to Rome, and thence in 1775
came to England. In 1777 he was admitted associate of the
Royal Academy; in 1783 he was made Academician on the
exhibition of his most famous picture, the &ldquo;Death of Chatham,&rdquo;
popularized immediately by Bartolozzi&rsquo;s elaborate engraving;
and in 1790 he was commissioned to paint a portrait picture of
the defence of Gibraltar. The &ldquo;Death of Major Pierson,&rdquo; in
the National Gallery, also deserves mention. Copley&rsquo;s powers
appear to greatest advantage in his portraits. He was the
father of Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPPÉE, FRANÇOIS ÉDOUARD JOACHIM<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1842-1908),
French poet and novelist, was born in Paris on the 12th of
January 1842. His father held a small post in the civil service,
and he owed much to the care of an admirable mother. After
passing through the Lycée Saint-Louis he became a clerk in
the ministry of war, and soon sprang into public favour as a
poet of the young &ldquo;Parnassian&rdquo; school. His first printed verses
date from 1864. They were republished with others in 1866 in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
a collected form (<i>Le Reliquaire</i>), followed (1867) by <i>Les Intimités</i>
and <i>Poèmes modernes</i> (1867-1869). In 1869 his first play, <i>Le
Passant</i>, was received with marked approval at the Odéon
theatre, and later <i>Fais ce que dois</i> (1871) and <i>Les Bijoux de la
délivrance</i> (1872), short metrical dramas inspired by the war,
were warmly applauded.</p>

<p>After filling a post in the library of the senate, Coppée was
chosen in 1878 as archivist of the Comédie-Française, an office
which he held till 1884. In that year his election to the Academy
caused him to retire altogether from his public appointments.
He continued to publish volumes of poetry at frequent intervals,
including <i>Les Humbles</i> (1872), <i>Le Cahier rouge</i> (1874), <i>Olivier</i>
(1875), <i>L&rsquo;Exilée</i> (1876), <i>Contes en vers</i>, &amp;c. (1881), <i>Poèmes et
récits</i> (1886), <i>Arrière-saison</i> (1887), <i>Paroles sincères</i> (1890). In
his later years his output of verse declined, but he published two
more volumes, <i>Dans la prière et la lutte</i> and <i>Vers français</i>. He
had established his fame as &ldquo;le poète des humbles.&rdquo; Besides
the plays mentioned above, two others written in collaboration
with Armand d&rsquo;Artois, and some light pieces of little importance,
Coppée produced <i>Madame de Maintenon</i> (1881), <i>Severo Torelli</i>
(1883), <i>Les Jacobites</i> (1885), and other serious dramas in verse,
including <i>Pour la couronne</i> (1895), which was translated into
English (<i>For the Crown</i>) by John Davidson, and produced at the
Lyceum Theatre in 1896. The performance of a short episode
of the Commune, <i>Le Pater</i>, was prohibited by the government
(1889). Coppée&rsquo;s first story in prose, <i>Une Idylle pendant le siège</i>,
appeared in 1875. It was followed by various volumes of short
tales, by <i>Toute une jeunesse</i> (1890)&mdash;an attempt to reproduce the
feelings, if not the actual wants, of the writer&rsquo;s youth,&mdash;<i>Les Vrais
Riches</i> (1892), <i>Le Coupable</i> (1896), &amp;c. He was made an officer of
the Legion of Honour in 1888. A series of reprinted short
articles on miscellaneous subjects, styled <i>Mon Franc Parler</i>,
appeared from 1893 to 1896; and in 1898 was published <i>La
Bonne Souffrance</i>, the outcome of Coppée&rsquo;s reconversion to the
Roman Catholic Church, which gained very wide popularity.
The immediate cause of his return to the faith was a severe illness
which twice brought him to the verge of the grave. Hitherto
he had taken little open interest in public affairs, but he now
joined the most violent section of Nationalist politicians, while
retaining contempt for the whole apparatus of democracy. He
took a leading part against the prisoner in the Dreyfus case,
and was one of the originators of the notorious Ligue de la Patrie
Française. He died on the 23rd of May 1908.</p>

<p>Alike in verse and prose Coppée concerned himself with the
plainest expressions of human emotion, with elemental patriotism,
and the joy of young love, and the pitifulness of the poor,
bringing to bear on each a singular gift of sympathy and insight.
The lyric and idyllic poetry, by which he will chiefly be remembered,
is animated by musical charm, and in some instances,
such as <i>La Bénédiction</i> and <i>La Grève des forgerons</i>, displays a
vivid, though not a sustained, power of expression. There is
force, too, in the gloomy tale, <i>Le Coupable</i>. But he exhibits all
the defects of his qualities. In prose especially, his sentiment
often degenerates into sentimentality, and he continually
approaches, and sometimes oversteps, the verge of the trivial.
Nevertheless, by neglecting that canon of contemporary art
which would reduce the deepest tragedies of life to mere subjects
for dissection, he won those common suffrages which are the prize
of exquisite literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPPER<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (symbol Cu, atomic weight 63.1, H = 1, or 63.6,
O = 16), a metal which has been known to and used by the human
race from the most remote periods. Its alloy with tin (bronze)
was the first metallic compound in common use by mankind,
and so extensive and characteristic was its employment in prehistoric
times that the epoch is known as the Bronze Age. By
the Greeks and Romans both the metal and its alloys were
indifferently known as <span class="grk" title="chalkos">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span> and <i>aes</i>. As, according to Pliny,
the Roman supply was chiefly drawn from Cyprus, it came to be
termed <i>aes cyprium</i>, which was gradually shortened to <i>cyprium</i>,
and corrupted into <i>cuprum</i>, whence comes the English word
copper, the French <i>cuivre</i>, and the German <i>Kupfer</i>.</p>

<p>Copper is a brilliant metal of a peculiar red colour which
assumes a pinkish or yellowish tinge on a freshly fractured surface
of the pure metal, and is purplish when the metal contains
cuprous oxide. Its specific gravity varies between 8.91 and
8.95, according to the treatment to which it may have been
subjected; J. F. W. Hampe gives 8.945 (<span class="spp">0°</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4°</span>) for perfectly pure
and compact copper. Ordinary commercial copper is somewhat
porous and has a specific gravity ranging from 8.2 to 8.5. It takes
a brilliant polish, is in a high degree malleable and ductile, and
in tenacity it only falls short of iron, exceeding in that quality
both silver and gold. By different authorities its melting-point
is stated at from 1000° to 1200° C.; C. T. Heycock and F. H.
Neville give 1080°.5; P. Dejean gives 1085° as the freezing-point.
The molten metal is sea-green in colour, and at higher
temperatures (in the electric arc) it vaporizes and burns with
a green flame. G. W. A. Kahlbaum succeeded in subliming the
metal in a vacuum, and H. Moissan (<i>Compt. rend.</i>, 1905, 141,
p. 853) distilled it in the electric furnace. Molten copper absorbs
carbon monoxide, hydrogen and sulphur dioxide; it also appears
to decompose hydrocarbons (methane, ethane), absorbing the
hydrogen and the carbon separating out. These occluded gases
are all liberated when the copper cools, and so give rise to porous
castings, unless special precautions are taken. The gases are
also expelled from the molten metal by lead, carbon dioxide,
or water vapour. Its specific heat is 0.0899 at 0° C. and 0.0942
at 100°; the coefficient of linear expansion per 1° C. is 0.001869.
In electric conductivity it stands next to silver; the conducting
power of silver being equal to 100, that of perfectly pure copper
is given by A. Matthiessen as 96.4 at 13° C.</p>

<p>Copper is not affected by exposure in dry air, but in a moist
atmosphere, containing carbonic acid, it becomes coated with a
green basic carbonate. When heated or rubbed it emits a peculiar
disagreeable odour. Sulphuric and hydrochloric acids have little
or no action upon it at ordinary temperatures, even when
in a fine state of division; but on heating, copper sulphate and
sulphur dioxide are formed in the first case, and cuprous chloride
and hydrogen in the second. Concentrated nitric acid has also
very little action, but with the dilute acid a vigorous action
ensues. The first products of this reaction are copper nitrate
and nitric oxide, but, as the concentration of the copper nitrate
increases, nitrous oxide and, eventually, free nitrogen are liberated.</p>

<p>Many colloidal solutions of copper have been obtained. A
reddish-brown solution is obtained from solutions of copper
chloride, stannous chloride and an alkaline tartrate (Lottermoser,
<i>Anorganische Colloïde</i>, 1901).</p>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>&mdash;Copper is widely distributed in nature, occurring
in most soils, ferruginous mineral waters, and ores. It has been
discovered in seaweed; in the blood of certain Cephalopoda and
Ascidia as haemocyanin, a substance resembling the ferruginous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
haemoglobin, and of a species of <i>Limulus</i>; in straw, hay, eggs,
cheese, meat, and other food-stuffs; in the liver and kidneys,
and, in traces, in the blood of man and other animals (as an entirely
adventitious constituent, however); it has also been shown
by A. H. Church to exist to the extent of 5.9% in turacin, the
colouring-matter of the wing-feathers of the Turaco.</p>

<p>Native copper, sometimes termed by miners malleable or
virgin copper, occurs as a mineral having all the properties
of the smelted metal. It crystallizes in the cubic system, but the
crystals are often flattened, elongated, rounded or otherwise
distorted. Twins are common. Usually the metal is arborescent,
dendritic, filiform, moss-like or laminar. Native copper is found
in most copper-mines, usually in the upper workings, where
the deposit has been exposed to atmospheric influences. The
metal seems to have been reduced from solutions of its salts, and
deposits may be formed around mine-timber or on iron objects.
It often fills cracks and fissures in the rock. It is not infrequently
found in serpentine, and in basic eruptive rocks, where it occurs
as veins and in amygdales. The largest known deposits are those
in the Lake Superior region, near Keweenaw Point, Michigan,
where masses upwards of 400 tons in weight have been discovered.
The metal was formerly worked by the Indians for
implements and ornaments. It occurs in a series of amygdaloidal
dolerites or diabases, and in the associated sandstones and conglomerates.
Native silver occurs with the copper, in some
cases embedded in it, like crystals in a porphyry. The copper is
also accompanied by epidote, calcite, prehnite, analcite and other
zeolitic minerals. Pseudomorphs after calcite are known; and
it is notable that native copper occurs pseudomorphous after
aragonite at Corocoro, in Bolivia, where the copper is disseminated
through sandstone.</p>

<p><i>Ores.</i>&mdash;The principal ores of copper are the oxides cuprite and
melaconite, the carbonates malachite and chessylite, the basic
chloride atacamite, the silicate chrysocolla, the sulphides
chalcocite, chalcopyrite, erubescite and tetrahedrite. Cuprite
(<i>q.v.</i>) occurs in most cupriferous mines, but never by itself in
large quantities. Melaconite (<i>q.v.</i>) was formerly largely worked
in the Lake Superior region, and is abundant in some of the
mines of Tennessee and the Mississippi valley. Malachite is a
valuable ore containing about 56% of the metal; it is obtained
in very large quantities from South Australia, Siberia and other
localities. Frequently intermixed with the green malachite is
the blue carbonate chessylite or azurite (<i>q.v.</i>), an ore containing
when pure 55.16% of the metal. Atacamite (<i>q.v.</i>) occurs chiefly
in Chile and Peru. Chrysocolla (<i>q.v.</i>) contains in the pure state
30% of the metal; it is an abundant ore in Chile, Wisconsin
and Missouri. The sulphur compounds of copper are, however,
the most valuable from the economic point of view. Chalcocite,
redruthite, copper-glance (<i>q.v.</i>) or vitreous copper (Cu<span class="su">2</span>S) contains
about 80% of copper. Copper pyrites, or chalcopyrite, contains
34.6% of copper when pure; but many of the ores, such as
those worked specially by wet processes on account of the presence
of a large proportion of iron sulphide, contain less than 5% of
copper. Cornish ores are almost entirely pyritic; and indeed
it is from such ores that by far the largest proportion of copper
is extracted throughout the world. In Cornwall copper lodes
usually run east and west. They occur both in the &ldquo;killas&rdquo;
or clay-slate, and in the &ldquo;growan&rdquo; or granite. Erubescite
(<i>q.v.</i>), bornite, or horseflesh ore is much richer in copper than the
ordinary pyrites, and contains 56 or 57% of copper. Tetrahedrite
(<i>q.v.</i>), fahlerz, or grey copper, contains from 30 to
48% of copper, with arsenic, antimony, iron and sometimes
zinc, silver or mercury. Other copper minerals are percylite
(PbCuCl<span class="su">2</span>(OH)<span class="su">2</span>), boleite (3PbCuCl<span class="su">2</span>(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, AgCl), stromeyerite
{(Cu, Ag)<span class="su">2</span>S}, cubanite (CuS, Fe<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>), stannite (Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, FeSnS<span class="su">3</span>),
tennantite (3Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, As<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>), emplectite (Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, Bi<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>), wolfsbergite
(Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>), famatinite (3Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">5</span>) and enargite (3Cu<span class="su">2</span>S,
As<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">5</span>). For other minerals, see <i>Compounds of Copper</i> below.</p>

<p><i>Metallurgy.</i>&mdash;Copper is obtained from its ores by three principal
methods, which may be denominated&mdash;(1) the pyro-metallurgical
or dry method, (2) the hydro-metallurgical or wet method, and
(3) the electro-metallurgical method.</p>

<p>The methods of working vary according to the nature of
the ores treated and local circumstances. The dry method,
or ordinary smelting, cannot be profitably practised with ores
containing less than 4% of copper, for which and for still poorer
ores the wet process is preferred.</p>

<p><i>Copper Smelting.</i>&mdash;We shall first give the general principles
which underlie the methods for the dry extraction of copper, and
then proceed to a more detailed discussion of the plant used.
Since all sulphuretted copper ores (and these are of the most
economic importance) are invariably contaminated with arsenic
and antimony, it is necessary to eliminate these impurities, as
far as possible, at a very early stage. This is effected by calcination
or roasting. The roasted ore is then smelted to a mixture
of copper and iron sulphides, known as copper &ldquo;matte&rdquo; or
&ldquo;coarse-metal,&rdquo; which contains little or no arsenic, antimony
or silica. The coarse-metal is now smelted, with coke and
siliceous fluxes (in order to slag off the iron), and the product,
consisting of an impure copper sulphide, is variously known as
&ldquo;blue-metal,&rdquo; when more or less iron is still present, &ldquo;pimple-metal,&rdquo;
when free copper and more or less copper oxide is present,
or &ldquo;fine&rdquo; or &ldquo;white-metal,&rdquo; which is a fairly pure copper
sulphide, containing about 75% of the metal. This product is
re-smelted to form &ldquo;coarse-copper,&rdquo; containing about 95% of
the metal, which is then refined. Roasted ores may be smelted
in reverberatory furnaces (English process), or in blast-furnaces
(German or Swedish process). The matte is treated either in
reverberatory furnaces (English process), in blast furnaces
(German process), or in converters (Bessemer process). The
&ldquo;American process&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pyritic smelting&rdquo; consists in the
direct smelting of raw ores to matte in blast furnaces. The
plant in which the operations are conducted varies in different
countries. But though this or that process takes its name from
the country in which it has been mainly developed, this does not
mean that only that process is there followed.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;English process&rdquo; is made up of the following operations:
(1) calcination; (2) smelting in reverberatory furnaces to form
the matte; (3) roasting the matte; and (4) subsequent smelting
in reverberatory furnaces to fine- or white-metal; (5) treating
the fine-metal in reverberatory furnaces to coarse- or blister-copper,
either with or without previous calcination; (6) refining
of the coarse-copper. A shorter process (the so-called &ldquo;direct
process&rdquo;) converts the fine-metal into refined copper directly.
The &ldquo;Welsh process&rdquo; closely resembles the English method;
the main difference consists in the enrichment of the matte by
smelting with the rich copper-bearing slags obtained in subsequent
operations. The &ldquo;German or Swedish process&rdquo; is
characterized by the introduction of blast-furnaces. It is made
up of the following operations: (1) calcination, (2) smelting in
blast-furnaces to form the matte, (3) roasting the matte, (4)
smelting in blast-furnaces with coke and fluxes to &ldquo;black-&rdquo; or
&ldquo;coarse-metal,&rdquo; (5) refining the coarse-metal. The &ldquo;Anglo-German
Process&rdquo; is a combination of the two preceding, and
consists in smelting the calcined ores in shaft furnaces, concentrating
the matte in reverberatory furnaces, and smelting to
coarse-metal in either.</p>

<p>The impurities contained in coarse-copper are mainly iron, lead,
zinc, cobalt, nickel, bismuth, arsenic, antimony, sulphur,
selenium and tellurium. These can be eliminated by an oxidizing
fusion, and slagging or volatilizing the products resulting from
this operation, or by electrolysis (see below). In the process
of oxidation, a certain amount of cuprous oxide is always formed,
which melts in with the copper and diminishes its softness and
tenacity. It is, therefore, necessary to reconvert the oxide into
the metal. This is effected by stirring the molten metal with a
pole of green wood (&ldquo;poling&rdquo;); the products which arise from
the combustion and distillation of the wood reduce the oxide to
metal, and if the operation be properly conducted &ldquo;tough-pitch&rdquo;
copper, soft, malleable and exhibiting a lustrous silky fracture,
is obtained. The surface of the molten metal is protected from
oxidation by a layer of anthracite or charcoal. &ldquo;Bean-shot&rdquo;
copper is obtained by throwing the molten metal into hot water;
if cold water be used, &ldquo;feathered-shot&rdquo; copper is formed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
&ldquo;Rosette&rdquo; copper is obtained as thin plates of a characteristic
dark-red colour, by pouring water upon the surface of the molten
metal, and removing the crust formed. &ldquo;Japan&rdquo; copper is
purple-red in colour, and is formed by casting into ingots,
weighing from six ounces to a pound, and rapidly cooling by
immersion in water. The colour of these two varieties is due to
a layer of oxide. &ldquo;Tile&rdquo; copper is an impure copper, and is
obtained by refining the first tappings. &ldquo;Best-selected&rdquo; copper
is a purer variety.</p>

<p><i>Calcination or Roasting and Calcining Furnaces.</i>&mdash;The roasting
should be conducted so as to eliminate as much of the arsenic
and antimony as possible, and to leave just enough sulphur as is
necessary to combine with all the copper present when the
calcined ore is smelted. The process is effected either in heaps,
stalls, shaft furnaces, reverberatory furnaces or muffle furnaces.
Stall and heap roasting require considerable time, and can only
be economically employed when the loss of the sulphur is of no
consequence; they also occupy much space, but they have the
advantage of requiring little fuel and handling. Shaft furnaces
are in use for ores rich in sulphur, and where it is desirable to
convert the waste gases into sulphuric acid. Reverberatory
roasting does not admit of the utilization of the waste gases,
and requires fine ores and much labour and fuel; it has, however,
the advantage of being rapid. Muffle furnaces are suitable for
fine ores which are liable to decrepitate or sinter. They involve
high cost in fuel and labour, but permit the utilization of the
waste gases.</p>

<p>Reverberatory furnaces of three types are employed in
calcining copper ores: (1) fixed furnaces, with either hand or
mechanical rabbling; (2) furnaces with movable beds; (3)
furnaces with rotating working chambers. Hand rabbling
in fixed furnaces has been largely superseded by mechanical
rabbling. Of mechanically rabbling furnaces we may mention
the O&rsquo;Harra modified by Allen-Brown, the Hixon, the Keller-Gaylord-Cole,
the Ropp, the Spence, the Wethey, the Parkes,
Pearce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Turret&rdquo; and Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Horseshoe&rdquo; furnaces.
Blake&rsquo;s and Brunton&rsquo;s furnaces are reverberatory furnaces with
a movable bed. Furnaces with rotating working chambers admit
of continuous working; the fuel and labour costs are both low.</p>

<p>In the White-Howell revolving furnace with lifters&mdash;a modification
of the Oxland&mdash;the ore is fed and discharged in a continuous
stream. The Brückner cylinder resembles the Elliot and Russell
black ash furnace; its cylinder tapers slightly towards each end,
and is generally 18 ft. long by 8 ft. 6 in. in its greatest diameter.
Its charge of from 8 to 12 tons of ore or concentrates is slowly
agitated at a rate of three revolutions a minute, and in from
24 to 36 hours it is reduced from say 40 or 35% to 7% of sulphur.
The ore is under better control than is possible with the continuous
feed and discharge, and when sufficiently roasted can be
passed red-hot to the reverberatory furnace. These advantages
compensate for the wear and tear and the cost of moving the
heavy dead-weight.</p>

<p>Shaft calcining furnaces are available for fine ores and permit
the recovery of the sulphur. They are square, oblong or circular
in section, and the interior is fitted with horizontal or inclined
plates or prisms, which regulate the fall of the ore. In the
Gerstenhoffer and Hasenclever-Helbig furnaces the fall is
retarded by prisms and inclined plates. In other furnaces the
ore rests on a series of horizontal plates, and either remains on
the same plate throughout the operation (Ollivier and Perret
furnace), or is passed from plate to plate by hand (Malétra),
or by mechanical means (Spence and M&rsquo;Dougall).</p>

<p>The M&rsquo;Dougall furnace is turret-shaped, and consists of a series
of circular hearths, on which the ore is agitated by rakes attached
to revolving arms and made to fall from hearth to hearth. It
has been modified by Herreshoff, who uses a large hollow revolving
central shaft cooled by a current of air. The shaft is provided
with sockets, into which movable arms with their rakes are
readily dropped. The Peter Spence type of calcining furnace
has been followed in a large number of inventions. In some the
rakes are attached to rigid frames, with a reciprocating motion,
in others to cross-bars moved by revolving chains. Some of
these furnaces are straight, others circular. Some have only
one hearth, others three. This and the previous type of furnace,
owing to their large capacity, are at present in greatest favour.
The M&rsquo;Dougall-Herreshoff, working on ores of over 30% of
sulphur, requires no fuel; but in furnaces of the reverberatory
type fuel must be used, as an excess of air enters through the
slotted sides and the hinged doors which open and shut frequently
to permit of the passage of the rakes. The consumption of fuel,
however, does not exceed 1 of coal to 10 of ore. The quantity of
ore which these large furnaces, with a hearth area as great as
2000 ft. and over, will roast varies from 40 to 60 tons a day.
Shaft calcining furnaces like the Gerstenhoffer, Hasenclever,
and others designed for burning pyrites fines have not found
favour in modern copper works.</p>

<p><i>The Fusion of Ores in Reverberatory and Cupola Furnaces.</i>&mdash;After
the ore has been partially calcined, it is smelted to extract
its earthy matter and to concentrate the copper with part of its
iron and sulphur into a matte. In reverberatory furnaces it is
smelted by fuel in a fireplace, separate from the ore, and in
cupolas the fuel, generally coke, is in direct contact with the ore.
When Swansea was the centre of the copper-smelting industry
in Europe, many varieties of ores from different mines were
smelted in the same furnaces, and the Welsh reverberatory
furnaces were used. To-day more than eight-tenths of the
copper ores of the world are reduced to impure copper bars or to
fine copper at the mines; and where the character of the ore
permits, the cupola furnace is found more economical in both
fuel and labour than the reverberatory.</p>

<p>The Welsh method finds adherents only in Wales and Chile.
In America the usual method is to roast ores or concentrates
so that the matte yielded by either the reverberatory or cupola
furnace will run from 45 to 50% in copper, and then to transfer
to the Bessemer converter, which blows it up to 99%. In Butte,
Montana, reverberatories have in the past been preferred to
cupola furnaces, as the charge has consisted mainly of fine
roasted concentrates; but the cupola is gaining ground there.
At the Boston and Great Falls (Montana) works tilting reverberatories,
modelled after open hearth steel furnaces, were first
erected; but they were found to possess objectionable features.
Now both these and the egg-shaped reverberatories are being
abandoned for furnaces as long as 43 ft. 6 in. from bridge to
bridge and of a width of 15 ft. 9 in. heated by gas, with regenerative
checker work at each end, and fed with ore or concentrates,
red-hot from the calciners, through a line of hoppers
suspended above the roof. Furnaces of this size smelt 200 tons
of charge a day. But even when the old type of reverberatory
is preferred, as at the Argo works, at Denver, where rich gold-
and silver-bearing copper matte is made, the growth of the
furnace in size has been steady. Richard Pearce&rsquo;s reverberatories
in 1878 had an area of hearth of 15 ft. by 9 ft. 8 in., and smelted
12 tons of cold charge daily, with a consumption of 1 ton of
coal to 2.4 tons of ore. In 1900 the furnaces were 35 ft. by 16 ft.,
and smelt 50 tons daily of hot ore, with the consumption of 1 ton
of coal to 3.7 tons of ore.</p>

<p>The home of cupola smelting was Germany, where it has never
ceased to make steady progress. In Mansfeld brick cupola
furnaces are without a rival in size, equipment and performance.
They are round stacks, designed on the model of iron blast
furnaces, 29 ft. high, fed mechanically, and provided with stoves
to heat the blast by the furnace gases. The low percentage of
sulphur in the roasted ore is little more than enough to produce
a matte of 40 to 45%, and therefore the escaping gases are
better fitted than those of most copper cupola furnaces for
burning in a stove. But as the slag carries on an average 46%
of silica, it is only through the utmost skill that it can be made
to run as low on an average as 0.3% in copper oxide. As the
matte contains on an average 0.2% of silver, it is still treated
by the Ziervogel wet method of extraction, the management
dreading the loss which might occur in the Bessemer process
of concentration, applied as preliminary to electrolytic separation.
Blast furnaces of large size, built of brick, have been constructed
for treating the richest and more silicious ores of Rio Tinto, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
the Rio Tinto Company has introduced converters at the mine.
This method of extraction contrasts favourably in time with
the leaching process, which is so slow that over 10,000,000
tons of ore are always under treatment on the immense leaching
floors of the company&rsquo;s works in Spain. In the United States
the cupola has undergone a radical modification in being built
of water-jacketed sections. The first water-jacketed cupola
which came into general use was a circular inverted cone, with
a slight taper, of 36 inches diameter at the tuyeres, and composed
of an outer and an inner metal shell, between which
water circulated. As greater size has been demanded, oval and
rectangular furnaces&mdash;as large as 180 in. by 56 in. at the tuyeres&mdash;have
been built in sections of cast or sheet iron or steel. A single
section can be removed and replaced without entirely emptying
the stack, as a shell of congealed slag always coats the inner
surface of the jacket. The largest furnaces are those of the
Boston &amp; Montana Company at Great Falls, Montana, which
have put through 500 tons of charge daily, pouring their melted
slag and matte into large wells of 10 ft. in diameter. A combined
brick- and water-cooled furnace has been adopted by the Iron
Mountain Company at Keswick, Cal., for matte concentration.
In it the cooling is effected by water pipes, interposed horizontally
between the layers of bricks. The Mt. Lyell smelting works in
Tasmania, which are of special interest, will be referred to later.
(See <i>Pyritic Smelting</i> below.)</p>

<p><i>Concentrating Matte to Copper in the Bessemer Converter.</i>&mdash;As
soon as the pneumatic method of decarburizing pig iron was
accepted as practicable, experiments were made with a view to
Bessemerizing copper ores and mattes. One of the earliest and
most exhaustive series of experiments was made on Rio Tinto
ores at the John Brown works by John Hollway, with the aim
of both smelting the ore and concentrating the matte in the
same furnace, by the heat evolved through the oxidation of
their sulphur and iron. Experiments along the same lines were
made by Francis Bawden at Rio Tinto and Claude Vautin in
Australia. The difficulty of effecting this double object in one
operation was so great that in subsequent experiments the aim
was merely to concentrate the matte to metallic copper in converters
of the Bessemer type. The concentration was effected
without any embarrassment till metallic copper commenced to
separate and chill in the bottom tuyeres. To meet this obstacle
P. Manhès proposed elevated side tuyeres, which could be kept
clear by punching through gates in a wind box. His invention
was adopted by the Vivians, at the Eguilles works near Sargues,
Vaucluse, France, and at Leghorn in Italy. But the greatest
expansion of this method has been in the United States, where
more than 400,000,000 &#8468; of copper are annually made in
Bessemer converters. Vessels of several designs are used&mdash;some
modelled exactly after steel converters, <span class="correction" title="amended from other">others</span> barrel-shaped,
but all with side tuyeres elevated about 10 in. above
the level of the bottom lining. Practice, however, in treating
copper matte differs essentially from the treatment of pig iron,
inasmuch as from 20 to 30% of iron must be eliminated as slag
and an equivalent quantity of silica must be supplied. The only
practical mode of doing this, as yet devised, is by lining the converter
with a silicious mixture. This is so rapidly consumed
that the converters must be cooled and partially relined after
3 to 6 charges, dependent on the iron contents of the matte.
When available, a silicious rock containing copper or the precious
metals is of course preferred to barren lining. The material
for lining, and the frequent replacement thereof, constitute the
principal expense of the method. The other items of cost are
<i>labour</i>, the quantity of which depends on the mechanical appliances
provided for handling the converter shells and inserting the
lining; and the <i>blast</i>, which in barrel-shaped converters is low
and in vertical converters is high, and which varies therefore
from 3 to 15 &#8468; to the square inch. The quantity of air consumed
in a converter which will blow up about 35 tons of matte per day
is about 3000 cub. ft. per minute. The operation of raising a
charge of 50% matte to copper usually consists of two blows.
The first blow occupies about 25 minutes, and oxidizes all but
a small quantity of the iron and some of the sulphur, raising
the product to white metal. The slag is then poured and
skimmed, the blast turned on and converter retilted. During the
second blow the sulphur is rapidly oxidized, and the charge
reduced to metal of 99% in from 30 to 40 minutes. Little or
no slag results from the second blow. That from the first blow
contains between 1% and 2% of copper, and is usually poured
from ladles operated by an electric crane into a reverberatory,
or into the settling well of the cupola. The matte also, in all
economically planned works, is conveyed, still molten, by
electric cranes from the furnace to the converters. When lead
or zinc is not present in notable quantity, the loss of the precious
metals by volatilization is slight, but more than 5% of these
metals in the matte is prohibitive. Under favourable conditions
in the larger works of the United States the cost of converting
a 50% matte to metallic copper is generally understood to be
only about <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> to <span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> of a cent per &#8468;. of refined copper.</p>

<p><i>Pyritic Smelting.</i>&mdash;The heat generated by the oxidation of
iron and sulphur has always been used to maintain combustion
in the kilns or stalls for roasting pyrites. Pyritic smelting is
a development of the Russian engineer Semenikov&rsquo;s treatment
(proposed in 1866) of copper matte in a Bessemer converter.
Since John Hollway&rsquo;s and other early experiments of Lawrence
Austin and Robert Sticht, no serious attempts have been made
to utilize the heat escaping from a converting vessel in smelting
ore and matte either in the same apparatus or in a separate
furnace. But considerable progress has been made in smelting
highly sulphuretted ores by the heat of their own oxidizable
constituents. At Tilt Cove, Newfoundland, the Cape Copper
Company smelted copper ore, with just the proper proportion
of sulphur, iron and silica, successfully without any fuel, when
once the initial charge had been fused with coke. The furnaces
used were of ordinary design and built of brick. Lump ore alone
was fed, and the resulting matte showed a concentration of only
3 into 1. When, however, a hot blast is used on highly
sulphuretted copper ores, a concentration of 8 of ore into 1 of
matte is obtained, with a consumption of less than one-third
the fuel which would be consumed in smelting the charge had
the ore been previously calcined. A great impetus to pyritic
smelting was given by the investigations of W. L. Austin, of
Denver, Colorado, and both at Leadville and Silverton raw ores
are successfully smelted with as low a fuel consumption as 3 of
coke to 100 of charge.</p>

<p>Two types of pyritic smelting may be distinguished: one,
in which the operation is solely sustained by the combustion of
the sulphur in the ores, without the assistance of fuel or a hot
blast; the other in which the operation is accelerated by fuel,
or a hot blast, or both. The largest establishment in which
advantage is taken of the self-contained fuel is at the smelting
works of the Mt. Lyell Company, Tasmania. There the blast
is raised from 600° to 700° F. in stoves heated by extraneous
fuel, and the raw ore smelted with only 3% of coke. The
ore is a compact iron pyrites containing copper 2.5%, silver
3.83 oz., gold 0.139 oz. It is smelted raw with hot blast in
cupola furnaces, the largest being 210 in. by 40 in. The resulting
matte runs 25%. This is reconcentrated raw in hot-blast
cupolas to 55%, and blown directly into copper in converters.
Thus these ores, as heavily charged with sulphur as those of the
Rio Tinto, are speedily reduced by three operations and without
roasting, with a saving of 97.6% of the copper, 93.2% of the
silver and 93.6% of the gold.</p>

<p>Pyritic smelting has met with a varying economic success.
According to Herbert Lang, its most prominent chance of success
is in localities where fuel is dear, and the ores contain precious
metals and sufficient sulphides and arsenides to render profitable
dressing unnecessary.</p>

<p><i>The Nicholls and James Process.</i>&mdash;Nicholls and James have
applied, very ingeniously, well-known reactions to the refining
of copper, raised to the grade of white metal. This process is
practised by the Cape Copper and Elliot Metal Company. A
portion of the white metal is calcined to such a degree of oxidation
that when fused with the unroasted portion, the reaction between
the oxygen in the roasted matte and the sulphur in the raw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
material liberates the metallic copper. The metal is so pure that
it can be refined by a continuous operation in the same furnace.</p>

<p><i>Wet Methods for Copper Extraction.</i>&mdash;Wet methods are only
employed for low grade ores (under favourable circumstances
ore containing from ¼ to 1% of copper has admitted of economic
treatment), and for gold and silver bearing metallurgical
products.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle consists in getting the ore into
a solution, from which the metal can be precipitated. The ores
of any economic importance contain the copper either as oxide,
carbonate, sulphate or sulphide. These compounds are got into
solution either as chlorides or sulphates, and from either of these
salts the metal can be readily obtained. Ores in which the
copper is present as oxide or carbonate are soluble in sulphuric
or hydrochloric acids, ferrous chloride, ferric sulphate, ammoniacal
compounds and sodium thiosulphate. Of these solvents, only
the first three are of economic importance. The choice of sulphuric
or hydrochloric acid depends mainly upon the cost, both
acting with about the same rapidity; thus if a Leblanc soda
factory is near at hand, then hydrochloric acid would most
certainly be employed. Ferrous chloride is not much used;
the Douglas-Hunt process uses a mixture of salt and ferrous
sulphate which involves the formation of ferrous chloride, and
the new Douglas-Hunt process employs sulphuric acid in which
ferrous chloride is added after leaching.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid may be applied as such on the ores placed in
lead, brick, or stone chambers; or as a mixture of sulphur
dioxide, nitrous fumes (generated from Chile saltpetre and
sulphuric acid), and steam, which permeates the ore resting on
the false bottom of a brick chamber. When most of the copper
has been converted into the sulphate, the ore is lixiviated.
Hydrochloric acid is applied in the same way as sulphuric acid;
it has certain advantages of which the most important is that
it does not admit the formation of basic salts; its chief disadvantage
is that it dissolves the oxides of iron, and accordingly
must not be used for highly ferriferous ores. The solubility of
copper carbonate in ferrous chloride solution was pointed out
by Max Schaffner in 1862, and the subsequent recognition of
the solubility of the oxide in the same solvent by James Douglas
and Sterry Hunt resulted in the &ldquo;Douglas-Hunt&rdquo; process for
the wet extraction of copper. Ferrous chloride decomposes the
copper oxide and carbonate with the formation of cuprous and
cupric chlorides (which remain in solution), and the precipitation
of ferrous oxide, carbon dioxide being simultaneously liberated
from the carbonate. In the original form of the Douglas-Hunt
process, ferrous chloride was formed by the interaction of sodium
chloride (common salt) with ferrous sulphate (green vitriol),
the sodium sulphate formed at the same time being removed by
crystallization. The ground ore was stirred with this solution
at 70° C. in wooden tubs until all the copper was dissolved. The
liquor was then filtered from the iron oxides, and the filtrate
treated with scrap iron, which precipitated the copper and
reformed ferrous chloride, which could be used in the first stage
of the process. The advantage of this method rests chiefly on
the small amount of iron required; but its disadvantages are
that any silver present in the ores goes into solution, the formation
of basic salts, and the difficulty of filtering from the iron
oxides. A modification of the method was designed to remedy
these defects. The ore is first treated with dilute sulphuric acid,
and then ferrous or calcium chloride added, thus forming copper
chlorides. If calcium chloride be used the precipitated calcium
sulphate must be removed by filtration. Sulphur dioxide is then
blown in, and the precipitate is treated with iron, which produces
metallic copper, or milk of lime, which produces cuprous oxide.
Hot air is blown into the filtrate, which contains ferrous or calcium
chlorides, to expel the excess of sulphur dioxide, and the liquid
can then be used again. In this process (&ldquo;new Douglas-Hunt&rdquo;)
there are no iron oxides formed, the silver is not dissolved, and
the quantity of iron necessary is relatively small, since all the
copper is in the cuprous condition. It is not used in the treatment
of ores, but finds application in the case of calcined argentiferous
lead and copper mattes.</p>

<p>The precipitation of the copper from the solution, in which
it is present as sulphate, or as cuprous and cupric chlorides, is
generally effected by metallic iron. Either wrought, pig, iron
sponge or iron bars are employed, and it is important to notice
that the form in which the copper is precipitated, and also the
time taken for the separation, largely depend upon the condition
in which the iron is applied. Spongy iron acts most rapidly, and
after this follow iron turnings and then sheet clippings. Other
precipitants such as sulphuretted hydrogen and solutions of
sulphides, which precipitate the copper as sulphides, and milk
of lime, which gives copper oxides, have not met with commercial
success. When using iron as the precipitant, it is desirable that
the solution should be as neutral as possible, and the quantity of
ferric salts present should be reduced to a minimum; otherwise,
a certain amount of iron would be used up by the free acid and
in reducing the ferric salts. Ores in which the copper is present
as sulphate are directly lixiviated and treated with iron. Mine
waters generally contain the copper in this form, and it is
extracted by conducting the waters along troughs fitted with iron
gratings.</p>

<p>The wet extraction of metallic copper from ores in which it
occurs as the sulphide, may be considered to involve the following
operations: (1) conversion of the copper into a soluble form,
(2) dissolving out the soluble copper salt, (3) the precipitation
of the copper. Copper sulphide may be converted either into
the sulphate, which is soluble in water; the oxide, soluble in
sulphuric or hydrochloric acid; cupric chloride, soluble in water;
or cuprous chloride, which is soluble in solutions of metallic
chlorides.</p>

<p>The conversion into sulphate is generally effected by the
oxidizing processes of weathering, calcination, heating with iron
nitrate or ferric sulphate. It may also be accomplished by
calcination with ferrous sulphate, or other easily decomposable
sulphates, such as aluminium sulphate. Weathering is a very
slow, and, therefore, an expensive process; moreover, the entire
conversion is only accomplished after a number of years. Calcination
is only advisable for ores which contain relatively much
iron pyrites and little copper pyrites. Also, however slowly the
calcination may be conducted, there is always more or less
copper sulphide left unchanged, and some copper oxide formed.
Calcination with ferrous sulphate converts all the copper sulphide
into sulphate. Heap roasting has been successfully employed
at Agordo, in the Venetian Alps, and at Majdanpek in Servia.
Josef Perino&rsquo;s process, which consists in heating the ore with iron
nitrate to 50°-150° C., is said to possess several advantages,
but it has not been applied commercially. Ferric sulphate is
only used as an auxiliary to the weathering process and in an
electrolytic process.</p>

<p>The conversion of the sulphide into oxide is adopted where the
Douglas-Hunt process is employed, or where hydrochloric or
sulphuric acids are cheap. The calcination is effected in reverberatory
furnaces, or in muffle furnaces, if the sulphur is to be
recovered. Heap, stall or shaft furnace roasting is not very
satisfactory, as it is very difficult to transform all the sulphide
into oxide.</p>

<p>The conversion of copper sulphide into the chlorides may
be accomplished by calcining with common salt, or by treating
the ores with ferrous chloride and hydrochloric acid or with
ferric chloride. The dry way is best; the wet way is only
employed when fuel is very dear, or when it is absolutely
necessary that no noxious vapours should escape into the
atmosphere. The dry method consists in an oxidizing roasting
of the ores, and a subsequent chloridizing roasting with either
common salt or <i>Abraumsalz</i> in reverberatory or muffle furnaces.
The bulk of the copper is thus transformed into cupric chloride,
little cuprous chloride being obtained. This method had been
long proposed by William Longmaid, Max Schaffner, Becchi and
Haupt, but was only introduced into England by the labours of
William Henderson, J. A. Phillips and others. The wet method
is employed at Rio Tinto, the particular variant being known
as the &ldquo;Dötsch&rdquo; process. This consists in stacking the broken
ore in heaps and adding a mixture of sodium sulphate and ferric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
chloride in the proportions necessary for the entire conversion
of the iron into ferric sulphate. The heaps are moistened with
ferric chloride solution, and the reaction is maintained by the
liquid percolating through the heap. The liquid is run off at the
base of the heaps into the precipitating tanks, where the copper
is thrown down by means of metallic iron. The ferrous chloride
formed at the same time is converted into ferric chloride which
can be used to moisten the heaps. This conversion is effected by
allowing the ferrous chloride liquors slowly to descend a tower,
filled with pieces of wood, coke or quartz, where it meets an
ascending current of chlorine.</p>

<p>The sulphate, oxide or chlorides, which are obtained from
the sulphuretted ores, are lixiviated and the metal precipitated
in the same manner as we have previously described.</p>

<p>The metal so obtained is known as &ldquo;cement&rdquo; copper. If it
contains more than 55% of copper it is directly refined, while
if it contains a lower percentage it is smelted with matte or
calcined copper pyrites. The chief impurities are basic salts of
iron, free iron, graphite, and sometimes silica, antimony and iron
arsenates. Washing removes some of these impurities, but some
copper always passes into the slimes. If much carbonaceous
matter be present (and this is generally so when iron sponge is
used as the precipitant) the crude product is heated to redness
in the air; this burns out the carbon, and, at the same time,
oxidizes a little of the copper, which must be subsequently
reduced. A similar operation is conducted when arsenic is
present; basic-lined reverberatory furnaces have been used for
the same purpose.</p>

<p><i>Electrolytic Refining.</i>&mdash;The principles have long been known
on which is based the electrolytic separation of copper from the
certain elements which generally accompany it, whether these,
like silver and gold, are valuable, or, like arsenic, antimony,
bismuth, selenium and tellurium, are merely impurities. But it
was not until the dynamo was improved as a machine for generating
large quantities of electricity at a very low cost that the
electrolysis of copper could be practised on a commercial scale.
To-day, by reason of other uses to which electricity is applied,
electrically deposited copper of high conductivity is in ever-increasing
demand, and commands a higher price than copper
refined by fusion. This increase in value permits of copper with
not over £2 or $10 worth of the precious metals being profitably
subjected to electrolytic treatment. Thus many million ounces
of silver and a great deal of gold are recovered which formerly
were lost.</p>

<p>The earliest serious attempt to refine copper industrially was
made by G. R. Elkington, whose first patent is dated 1865.
He cast crude copper, as obtained from the ore, into plates
which were used as anodes, sheets of electro-deposited copper
forming the cathodes. Six anodes were suspended, alternately
with four cathodes, in a saturated solution of copper sulphate in
a cylindrical fire-clay trough, all the anodes being connected
in one parallel group, and all the cathodes in another. A hundred
or more jars were coupled in series, the cathodes of one to the
anodes of the next, and were so arranged that with the aid of
side-pipes with leaden connexions and india-rubber joints the
electrolyte could, once daily, be made to circulate through them
all from the top of one jar to the bottom of the next. The current
from a Wilde&rsquo;s dynamo was passed, apparently with a current
density of 5 or 6 amperes per sq. ft., until the anodes were too
crippled for further use. The cathodes, when thick enough, were
either cast and rolled or sent into the market direct. Silver and
other insoluble impurities collected at the bottom of the trough
up to the level of the lower side-tube, and were then run off
through a plug in the bottom into settling tanks, from which
they were removed for metallurgical treatment. The electrolyte
was used until the accumulation of iron in it was too great, but
was mixed from time to time with a little water acidulated by
sulphuric acid. This process is of historic interest, and in
principle it is identical with that now used. The modifications
introduced have been chiefly in details, in order to economize
materials and labour, to ensure purity of product, and to increase
the rate of deposition.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chemistry of the process has been studied by Martin Kiliani
(<i>Berg- und Hüttenmännische Zeitung</i>, 1885, p. 249), who found
that, using the (low) current-density of 1.8 ampere per sq. ft. of
cathode, and an electrolyte containing 1½ &#8468; of copper sulphate
and ½ &#8468; of sulphuric acid per gallon, all the gold, platinum and
silver present in the crude copper anode remain as metals, undissolved,
in the anode slime or mud, and all the lead remains there
as sulphate, formed by the action of the sulphuric acid (or SO<span class="su">4</span> ions);
he found also that arsenic forms arsenious oxide, which dissolves
until the solution is saturated, and then remains in the slime, from
which on long standing it gradually dissolves, after conversion by
secondary reactions into arsenic oxide; antimony forms a basic
sulphate which in part dissolves; bismuth partly dissolves and
partly remains, but the dissolved portion tends slowly to separate
out as a basic salt which becomes added to the slime; cuprous oxide,
sulphide and selenides remain in the slime, and very slowly pass
into solution by simple chemical action; tin partly dissolves (but
in part separates again as basic salt) and partly remains as basic
sulphate and stannic oxide; zinc, iron, nickel and cobalt pass into
solution&mdash;more readily indeed than does the copper. Of the metals
which dissolve, none (except bismuth, which is rarely present in
any quantity) deposits at the anode so long as the solution retains
its proper proportion of copper and acid, and the current-density
is not too great. Neutral solutions are to be avoided because in them
silver dissolves from the anode and, being more electro-negative than
copper, is deposited at the cathode, while antimony and arsenic are
also deposited, imparting a dark colour to the copper. Electrolytic
copper should contain at least 99.92% of metallic copper, the balance
consisting mainly of oxygen with not more than 0.01% in all of
lead, arsenic, antimony, bismuth and silver. Such a degree of
purity is, however, unattainable unless the conditions of electrolysis
are rigidly adhered to. It should be observed that the free acid is
gradually neutralized, partly by chemical action on certain constituents
of the slime, partly by local action between different metals
of the anode, both of which effect solution independently of the
current, and partly by the peroxidation (or aëration) of ferrous
sulphate formed from the iron in the anode. At the same time there
is a gradual substitution of other metals for copper in the solution,
because although copper <i>plus</i> other (more electro-positive) metals
are constantly dissolving at the anode, only copper is deposited at
the cathode. Hence the composition and acidity of the solution,
on which so much depends, must be constantly watched.</p>

<p>The dependence of the mechanical qualities of the copper upon
the current-density employed is well known. A very weak current
gives a pale and brittle deposit, but as the current-density is increased
up to a certain point, the properties of the metal improve;
beyond this point they deteriorate, the colour becoming darker and
the deposit less coherent, until at last it is dark brown and spongy
or pulverulent. The presence of even a small proportion of hydrochloric
acid imparts a brown tint to the deposit. Baron H. v. Hübl
(<i>Mittheil. des k. k. militär-geograph. Inst.</i>, 1886, vol. vi. p. 51) has
found that with neutral solutions a 5% solution of copper sulphate
gave no good result, while with a 20% solution the best deposit was
obtained with a current-density of 28 amperes per sq. ft.; with
solutions containing 2% of sulphuric acid, the 5% solution gave
good deposits with current-densities of 4 to 7.5 amperes, and the
20% solution with 11.5 to 37 amperes, per sq. ft. The maximum
current-densities for a <i>pure</i> acid solution at rest were: for 15% pure
copper sulphate solutions 14 to 21 amperes, and for 20% solutions
18.5 to 28 amperes, per sq. ft.; but when the solutions were kept
in gentle motion these maxima could be increased to 21-28 and
28-37 amperes per sq. ft. respectively. The necessity for adjusting
the current-density to the composition and treatment of the electrolyte
is thus apparent. The advantage of keeping the solution in
motion is due partly to the renewal of solution thus effected in the
neighbourhood of the electrodes, and partly to the neutralization of
the tendency of liquids undergoing electrolysis to separate into layers,
due to the different specific gravities of the solutions flowing from
the opposing electrodes. Such an irregular distribution of the
bath, with strong copper sulphate solution from the anode at the
bottom and acid solution from the cathode at the top, not only
alters the conductivity in different strata and so causes irregular
current-distribution, but may lead to the current-density in the
upper layers being too great for the proportion of copper there
present. Irregular and defective deposits are therefore obtained.
Provision for circulation of solution is made in the systems of
copper-refining now in use. Henry Wilde, in 1875, in depositing
copper on iron printing-rollers, recognized this principle and rotated
the rollers during electrolysis, thereby renewing the surfaces of metal
and liquid in mutual contact, and imparting sufficient motion to
the solution to prevent stratification; as an alternative he imparted
motion to the electrolyte by means of propeller blades. Other
workers have followed more or less on the same lines; reference
may be made to the patents of F. E. and A. S. Elmore, who sought
to improve the character of the deposit by burnishing during electrolysis,
of E. Dumoulin, and Sherard Cowper-Coles (<i>Engineering
Review</i>, 1905, vol. xiii. p. 392), who prefers to rotate the cathode
at a speed that maintains a peripheral velocity of at least 1000 ft.
per minute. Certain other inventors have applied the same principle
in a different way. H. Thofehrn in America and J. C. Graham in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
England have patented processes by which jets of the electrolyte
are caused to impinge with considerable force upon the surface of
the cathode, so that the renewal of the liquid at this point takes
place very rapidly, and current-densities per sq. ft. of 50 to 100
amperes are recommended by the former, and of 300 amperes by the
latter. Graham has described experiments in this direction, using
a jet of electrolyte forced (beneath the surface of the bath) through
a hole in the anode upon the surface of the cathode. Whilst the jet
was playing, a good deposit was formed with so high a current-density
as 280 amperes per sq. ft., but if the jet was checked, the deposit
(now in a still liquid) was instantaneously ruined. When two or
more jets were used side by side the deposit was good opposite the
centre of each, but bad at the point where two currents met, because
the rate of flow was reduced. By introducing perforated shields
of ebonite between the electrodes, so that the full current-density
was only attained at the centres of the jets, these ill effects could
be prevented. One of the chief troubles met with was the formation
of arborescent growths around the edges of the cathode, due to the
greater current-density in this region; this, however, was also
obviated by the use of screens. By means of a very brisk rotation
of cathode, combined with a rapid current of electrolyte, J. W.
Swan has succeeded in depositing excellent copper at current-densities
exceeding 1000 amperes per sq. ft. The methods by which
such results are to be obtained cannot, however, as yet be practised
economically on a working scale; one great difficulty in applying
them to the refining of metals is that the jets of liquid would be
liable to carry with them articles of anode mud, and Swan has shown
that the presence of solid particles in the electrolyte is one of the
most fruitful causes of the well-known nodular growths on electro-deposited
copper. Experiments on a working scale with one of the
jet processes in America have, it is reported, been given up after a
full trial.</p>

<p>In copper-refining practice, the current-density commonly ranges
from 7.5 to 12 or 15, and occasionally to 18, amperes per sq. ft.
The electrical pressure required to force a current of this intensity
through the solution, and to overcome a certain opposing electromotive
force arising from the more electro-negative impurities of
the anode, depends upon the composition of the bath and of the
anodes, the distance between the electrodes, and the temperature,
but under the usual working conditions averages 0.3 volt for every
pair of electrodes in series. In nearly all the processes now used,
the solution contains about 1½ to 2 &#8468; of copper sulphate and from
5 to 10 oz. of sulphuric acid per gallon of water, and the space
between the electrodes is from 1½ to 2 in., whilst the total area of
cathode surface in each tank may be 200 sq. ft., more or less. The
anodes are usually cast copper plates about (say) 3 ft. by 2 ft. by
¾ or 1 in. The cathodes are frequently of electro-deposited copper,
deposited to a thickness of about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span> in. on black-leaded copper plates,
from which they are stripped before use. The tanks are commonly
constructed of wood lined with lead, or tarred inside, and are placed
in terrace fashion each a little higher than the next in series, to
facilitate the flow of solution through them all from a cistern at
one end to a well at the other. Gangways are left between adjoining
rows of tanks, and an overhead travelling-crane facilitates the
removal of the electrodes. The arrangement of the tanks depends
largely upon the voltage available from the electric generator
selected; commonly they are divided into groups, all the baths in
each group being in series. In the huge Anaconda plant, for example,
in which 150 tons of refined copper can be produced daily by the
Thofehrn multiple system (not the jet system alluded to above),
there are 600 tanks about 8¼ ft. by 4½ ft. by 3¼ ft. deep, arranged
in three groups of 200 tanks in series. The connexions are made
by copper rods, each of which, in length, is twice the width of the
tank, with a bayonet-bend in the middle, and serves to support
the cathodes in the one and the anodes in the next tank. Self-registering
voltmeters indicate at any moment the potential difference
in every tank, and therefore give notice of short circuits occurring
at any part of the installation. The chief differences between the
commercial systems of refining lie in the arrangement of the baths,
in the disposition and manner of supporting the electrodes in each,
in the method of circulating the solution, and in the current-density
employed. The various systems are often classed in two groups,
known respectively as the <i>Multiple</i> and <i>Series</i> systems, depending
upon the arrangement of the electrodes in each tank. Under the
multiple system anodes and cathodes are placed alternately, all the
anodes in one tank being connected to one rod, and all the cathodes
to another, and the potential difference between the terminals of
each tank is that between a single pair of plates. Under the series
system only the first anode and the last cathode are connected to
the conductors; between these are suspended, isolated from one
another, a number of intermediate bi-polar electrode plates of raw
copper, each of these plates acting on one side as a cathode, receiving
a deposit of copper, and on the other as an anode, passing into
solution; the voltage between the terminals of the tank will be as
many times as great as that between a single pair of plates as there
are spaces between electrodes in the tank. In time the original
impure copper of the plates becomes replaced by refined copper,
but if the plates are initially very impure and dissolve irregularly,
it may happen that much residual scrap may have to be remelted,
or that some of the metal may be twice refined, thus involving a
waste of energy. Moreover, the high potential difference between
the terminals of the series tank introduces a greater danger of short-circuiting
through scraps of metal at the bottom of the bath; for
this reason, also, lead-lined vats are inadmissible, and tarred slate
tanks are often used instead. A valuable comparison of the multiple
and series systems has been published by E. Keller (see <i>The Mineral
Industry</i>, New York, 1899, vol. vii. p. 229). G. Kroupa has calculated
that the cost of refining is 8s. per ton of copper higher under
the series than it is under the multiple system; but against this, it
must be remembered that the new works of the Baltimore Copper
Smelting and Rolling Company, which are as large as those of the
Anaconda Copper Mining Company, are using the Hayden process,
which is the chief representative of the several series systems. In
this system rolled copper anodes are used; these, being purer than
many cast anodes, having flat surfaces, and being held in place by
guides, dissolve with great regularity and require a space of only
<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. between the electrodes, so that the potential difference between
each pair of plates may be reduced to 0.15-0.2 volt.</p>

<p>J. A. W. Borchers, in Germany, and A. E. Schneider and O.
Szontagh, in America, have introduced a method of circulating the
solution in each vat by forcing air into a vertical pipe communicating
between the bottom and top of a tank, with the result that
the bubbling of the air upward aspirates solution through the vertical
pipe from below, at the same time aërating it, and causing it to
overflow into the top of the tank. Obviously this slow circulation
has but little effect on the rate at which the copper may be deposited.
The electrolyte, when too impure for further use, is
commonly recrystallized, or electrolysed with insoluble anodes to
recover the copper.</p>

<p>The yield of copper per ampere (in round numbers, 1 oz. of copper
per ampere per diem) by Faraday&rsquo;s law is never attained in practice;
and although 98% may with care be obtained, from 94 to 96%
represents the more usual current-efficiency. With 100% current-efficiency
and a potential difference of 0.3 volt between the electrodes,
1 &#8468; of copper should require about 0.154 electrical horse-power
hours as the amount of energy to be expended in the tank for its
production. In practice the expenditure is somewhat greater than
this; in large works the gross horse-power required for the refining
itself and for power and lighting in the factory may not exceed
0.19 to 0.2 (or in smaller works 0.25) horse-power hours per pound
of copper refined.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to use crude sulphide of copper
or matte as an anode, and recover the copper at the cathode, the
sulphur and other insoluble constituents being left at the anode.
The best known of these is the Marchese process, which was tested
on a working scale at Genoa and Stolberg in Rhenish Prussia. As
the operation proceeded, it was found that the voltage had to be
raised until it became prohibitive, while the anodes rapidly became
honeycombed through and, crumbling away, filled up the space at
the bottom of the vat. The process was abandoned, but in a modified
form appears to be now in use in Nijni-Novgorod in Russia. Siemens
and Halske introduced a combined process in which the ore, after
being part-roasted, is leached by solutions from a previous electrolytic
operation, and the resulting copper solution electrolysed.
In this process the anode solution had to be kept separate from the
cathode solution, and the membrane which had in consequence to be
used, was liable to become torn, and so to cause trouble by permitting
the two solutions to mix. Modifications of the process have therefore
been tried.</p>
</div>

<p>Modern methods in copper smelting and refining have effected
enormous economy in time, space, and labour, and have consequently
increased the world&rsquo;s output. With pyritic smelting a
sulphuretted copper ore, fed into a cupola in the morning, can be
passed directly to the converter, blown up to metal, and shipped
as 99% bars by evening&mdash;an operation which formerly, with
heap roasting of the ore and repeated roasting of the mattes in
stalls, would have occupied not less than four months. A large
furnace and a Bessemer converter, the pair capable of making a
million pounds of copper a month from a low-grade sulphuretted
ore, will not occupy a space of more than 25ft. by 100ft.; and
whereas, in making metallic copper out of a low-grade sulphuretted
ore, one day&rsquo;s labour used to be expended on every ton of ore
treated, to-day one day&rsquo;s labour will carry at least four tons of
ore through the different mechanical and metallurgical processes
necessary to reduce them to metal. About 70% of the world&rsquo;s
annual copper output is refined electrolytically, and from the
461,583 tons refined in the United States in 1907, there were
recovered 13,995,436 oz. of silver and 272,150 oz. of gold. The
recovery of these valuable metals has contributed in no small
degree to the expansion of electrolytic refining.</p>

<p><i>Production.</i>&mdash;The sources of copper, its applications and its
metallurgy, have undergone great changes. Chile was the
largest producer in 1869 with 54,867 tons; but in 1899 her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
production had fallen off to 25,000 tons. Great Britain, though
she had made half the world&rsquo;s copper in 1830, held second place in
1860, making from native ores 15,968 tons; in 1900 her production
was 777 tons, and in 1907, 711 tons. The United States
made only 572 tons in 1850, and 12,600 tons in 1870; but she to-day
makes more than 60% of the world&rsquo;s total. In 1879, Spain
was the largest producer, but now ranks third.</p>

<p>The estimated total production for each decade of the 19th
century in metric tons is here shown:&mdash;</p>

<p>As the stock on hand rarely exceeds three months&rsquo; demand,
and is often little more than a month&rsquo;s supply, it is evident that
consumption has kept close pace with production.</p>

<p>The large demand for copper to be used in sheathing ships
ceased on the introduction of iron in shipbuilding because of the
difficulty of coating iron with an impervious layer of copper; but
the consumption in the manufacture of electric apparatus and for
electric conductors has far more than compensated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Alloys of Copper.</i>&mdash;Copper unites with almost all other metals,
and a large number of its alloys are of importance in the arts. The
principal alloys in which it forms a leading ingredient are brass,
bronze, and German or nickel silver; under these several heads their
respective applications and qualities will be found.</p>

<p><i>Compounds of Copper.</i>&mdash;Copper probably forms six oxides, viz.
Cu<span class="su">4</span>O, Cu<span class="su">3</span>O, Cu<span class="su">2</span>O, CuO, Cu<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span> and CuO<span class="su">2</span>. The most important are
cuprous oxide, Cu<span class="su">2</span>O, and cupric oxide, CuO, both of
<span class="sidenote">Oxides and hydroxides.</span>
which give rise to well-defined series of salts. The other
oxides do not possess this property, as is also the case
of the hydrated oxides Cu<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span>2H<span class="su">2</span>O and Cu<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">3</span>5H<span class="su">2</span>O, described
by M. Siewert.</p>

<p>Cuprous oxide, Cu<span class="su">2</span>O, occurs in nature as the mineral cuprite (<i>q.v.</i>).
It may be prepared artificially by heating copper wire to a white
heat, and afterwards at a red heat, by the atmospheric oxidation
of copper reduced in hydrogen, or by the slow oxidation of the metal
under water. It is obtained as a fine red crystalline precipitate by
reducing an alkaline copper solution with sugar. When finely
divided it is of a fine red colour. It fuses at red heat, and colours
glass a ruby-red. The property was known to the ancients and
during the middle ages; it was then lost for several centuries, to
be rediscovered in about 1827. Cuprous oxide is reduced by hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, charcoal, or iron, to the metal; it dissolves
in hydrochloric acid forming cuprous chloride, and in other mineral
acids to form cupric salts, with the separation of copper. It dissolves
in ammonia, forming a colourless solution which rapidly oxidizes
and turns blue. A hydrated cuprous oxide, (4Cu<span class="su">2</span>O, H<span class="su">2</span>O), is obtained
as a bright yellow powder, when cuprous chloride is treated with
potash or soda. It rapidly absorbs oxygen, assuming a blue colour.
Cuprous oxide corresponds to the series of cuprous salts, which are
mostly white in colour, insoluble in water, and readily oxidized
to cupric salts.</p>

<p>Cupric oxide, CuO, occurs in nature as the mineral melaconite
(<i>q.v.</i>), and can be obtained as a hygroscopic black powder by the
gentle ignition of copper nitrate, carbonate or hydroxide; also by
heating the hydroxide. It oxidizes carbon compounds to carbon
dioxide and water, and therefore finds extensive application in
analytical organic chemistry. It is also employed to colour glass,
to which it imparts a light green colour. Cupric hydroxide,
Cu(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained as a greenish-blue flocculent precipitate by
mixing cold solutions of potash and a cupric salt. This precipitate
always contains more or less potash, which cannot be entirely
removed by washing. A purer product is obtained by adding
ammonium chloride, filtering, and washing with hot water. Several
hydrated oxides, <i>e.g.</i> Cu(OH)<span class="su">2</span>·3CuO, Cu(OH)<span class="su">2</span>·6H<span class="su">2</span>O, 6CuO·H<span class="su">2</span>O, have
been described. Both the oxide and hydroxide dissolve in ammonia
to form a beautiful azure-blue solution (Schweizer&rsquo;s reagent), which
dissolves cellulose, or perhaps, holds it in suspension as water does
starch; accordingly, the solution rapidly perforates paper or calico.
The salts derived from cupric oxide are generally white when
anhydrous, but blue or green when hydrated.</p>

<p>Copper quadrantoxide, Cu<span class="su">4</span>O, is an olive-green powder formed by
mixing well-cooled solutions of copper sulphate and alkaline stannous
chloride. The trientoxide, Cu<span class="su">3</span>O, is obtained when cupric oxide is
heated to 1500°-2000° C. It forms yellowish-red crystals, which
scratch glass, and are unaffected by all acids except hydrofluoric;
it also dissolves in molten potash. Copper dioxide, CuO<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">2</span>O, is
obtained as a yellowish-brown powder, by treating cupric hydrate
with hydrogen peroxide. When moist, it decomposes at about
6° C., but the dry substance must be heated to about 180°, before
decomposition sets in (see L. Moser, <i>Abst. J.C.S.</i>, 1907, ii. p. 549).</p>

<p>Cuprous hydride, (CuH)<span class="su">n</span>, was first obtained by Wurtz in 1844,
who treated a solution of copper sulphate with hypophosphorous
acid, at a temperature not exceeding 70° C. According to E. J.
Bartlett and W. H. Merrill, it decomposes when heated, and gives
cupric hydride, CuH<span class="su">2</span>, as a reddish-brown spongy mass, which turns
to a chocolate colour on exposure. It is a strong reducing agent.</p>

<p>Cuprous fluoride, CuF, is a ruby-red crystalline mass, formed by
heating cuprous chloride in an atmosphere of hydrofluoric acid at
1100°-1200° C. It is soluble in boiling hydrochloric acid, but it is
not reprecipitated by water, as is the case with cuprous chloride.
Cupric fluoride, CuF<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained by dissolving cupric oxide in
hydrofluoric acid. The hydrated form, (CuF<span class="su">2</span>, 2H<span class="su">2</span>O, 5HF), is obtained
as blue crystals, sparingly soluble in cold water; when heated to
100° C. it gives the compound CuF(OH), which, when heated with
ammonium fluoride in a current of carbon dioxide, gives anhydrous
copper fluoride as a white powder.</p>

<p>Cuprous chloride, CuCl or Cu<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>, was obtained by Robert Boyle
by heating copper with mercuric chloride. It is also obtained by
burning the metal in chlorine, by heating copper and cupric oxide
with hydrochloric acid, or copper and cupric chloride with hydrochloric
acid. It dissolves in the excess of acid, and is precipitated
as a white crystalline powder on the addition of water. It melts at
below red heat to a brown mass, and its vapour density at both
red and white heat corresponds to the formula Cu<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>. It turns
dirty violet on exposure to air and light; in moist air it absorbs
oxygen and forms an oxychloride. Its solution in hydrochloric acid
readily absorbs carbon monoxide and acetylene; hence it finds
application in gas analysis. Its solution in ammonia is at first
colourless, but rapidly turns blue, owing to oxidation. This solution
absorbs acetylene with the precipitation of red cuprous acetylide,
Cu<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>, a very explosive compound. Cupric chloride, CuCl<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained
by burning copper in an excess of chlorine, or by heating the
hydrated chloride, obtained by dissolving the metal or cupric oxide
in an excess of hydrochloric acid. It is a brown deliquescent powder,
which rapidly forms the green hydrated salt CuCl<span class="su">2</span>, 2H<span class="su">2</span>O on exposure.
The oxychloride Cu<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O is obtained as a pale blue precipitate
when potash is added to an excess of cupric chloride. The
oxychloride Cu<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">3</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>, 4H<span class="su">2</span>O occurs in nature as the mineral atacamite.
It may be artificially prepared by heating salt with ammonium
copper sulphate to 100°. Other naturally occurring oxychlorides
are botallackite and tallingite. &ldquo;Brunswick green,&rdquo; a light green
pigment, is obtained from copper sulphate and bleaching powder.</p>

<p>The bromides closely resemble the chlorides and fluorides.</p>

<p>Cuprous iodide, Cu<span class="su">2</span>I<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained as a white powder, which suffers
little alteration on exposure, by the direct union of its components
or by mixing solutions of cuprous chloride in hydrochloric acid and
potassium iodide; or, with liberation of iodine, by adding potassium
iodide to a cupric salt. It absorbs ammonia, forming the compound
Cu<span class="su">2</span>I<span class="su">2</span>, 4NH<span class="su">3</span>. Cupric iodide is only known in combination, as in
CuI<span class="su">2</span>, 4NH<span class="su">3</span>, H<span class="su">2</span>O, which is obtained by exposing Cu<span class="su">2</span>I<span class="su">2</span>, 4NH<span class="su">3</span> to
moist air.</p>

<p>Cuprous sulphide, Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, occurs in nature as the mineral chalcocite
or copper-glance (<i>q.v.</i>), and may be obtained as a black brittle mass
by the direct combination of its constituents. (See above, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metallurgy</a></span>.)
Cupric sulphide, CuS, occurs in nature as the mineral covellite.
It may be prepared by heating cuprous sulphide with sulphur, or
triturating cuprous sulphide with cold strong nitric acid, or as a
dark brown precipitate by treating a copper solution with sulphuretted
hydrogen. Several polysulphides, <i>e.g.</i> Cu<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">5</span>, Cu<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">6</span>, Cu<span class="su">4</span>S<span class="su">6</span>,
Cu<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>, have been described; they are all unstable, decomposing
into cupric sulphide and sulphur. Cuprous sulphite, CuSO<span class="su">3</span>·H<span class="su">2</span>O, is
obtained as a brownish-red crystalline powder by treating cuprous
hydrate with sulphurous acid. A cuproso-cupric sulphite, Cu<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">3</span>,
CuSO<span class="su">3</span>,2H<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained by mixing solutions of cupric sulphate and
acid sodium sulphite.</p>

<p>Cupric sulphate or &ldquo;Blue Vitriol,&rdquo; CuSO<span class="su">4</span>, is one of the most important
salts of copper. It occurs in cupriferous mine waters and as
the minerals chalcanthite or cyanosite, CuSO<span class="su">4</span>·5H<span class="su">2</span>O, and boothite,
CuSO<span class="su">4</span>·7H<span class="su">2</span>O. Cupric sulphate is obtained commercially by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
oxidation of sulphuretted copper ores (see above, <i>Metallurgy; wet
methods</i>), or by dissolving cupric oxide in sulphuric acid. It was
obtained in 1644 by Van Helmont, who heated copper with sulphur
and moistened the residue, and in 1648 by Glauber, who dissolved
copper in strong sulphuric acid. (For the mechanism of this reaction
see C. H. Sluiter, <i>Chem. Weekblad</i>, 1906, 3, p. 63, and C. M. van
Deventer, ibid., 1906, 3, p. 515.) It crystallizes with five molecules
of water as large blue triclinic prisms. When heated to 100°, it loses
four molecules of water and forms the bluish-white monohydrate,
which, on further heating to 25O°-260°, is converted into the white
CuSO<span class="su">4</span>. The anhydrous salt is very hygroscopic, and hence finds
application as a desiccating agent. It also absorbs gaseous hydrochloric
acid. Copper sulphate is readily soluble in water, but insoluble
in alcohol; it dissolves in hydrochloric acid with a considerable
fall in temperature, cupric chloride being formed. The copper
is readily replaced by iron, a knife-blade placed in an aqueous
solution being covered immediately with a bright red deposit of
copper. At one time this was regarded as a transmutation of iron
into copper. Several basic salts are known, some of which occur as
minerals; of these, we may mention brochantite (<i>q.v.</i>), CuSO<span class="su">4</span>,
3Cu(OH<span class="su">2</span>), langite, CuSO<span class="su">4</span>, 3Cu(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, H<span class="su">2</span>O, lyellite (or devilline),
warringtonite; woodwardite and enysite are hydrated copper-aluminium
sulphates, connellite is a basic copper chlorosulphate,
and spangolite is a basic copper aluminium chlorosulphate. Copper
sulphate finds application in calico printing and in the preparation
of the pigment Scheele&rsquo;s green.</p>

<p>A copper nitride, Cu<span class="su">3</span>N, is obtained by heating precipitated cuprous
oxide in ammonia gas (A. Guntz and H. Bassett, <i>Bull. Soc. Chim.</i>,
1906, 35, p. 201). A maroon-coloured powder, of composition CuNO<span class="su">2</span>,
is formed when pure dry nitrogen dioxide is passed over finely-divided
copper at 25°-30°. It decomposes when heated to 90°;
with water it gives nitric oxide and cupric nitrate and nitrite.
Cupric nitrate, Cu(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained by dissolving the metal or oxide
in nitric acid. It forms dark blue prismatic crystals containing
3, 4, or 6 molecules of water according to the temperature of crystallization.
The trihydrate melts at 114.5°, and boils at 170°, giving
off nitric acid, and leaving the basic salt Cu(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·3Cu(OH)<span class="su">2</span>. The
mineral gerhardtite is the basic nitrate Cu<span class="su">2</span>(OH)<span class="su">3</span>NO<span class="su">3</span>.</p>

<p>Copper combines directly with phosphorus to form several
compounds. The phosphide obtained by heating cupric phosphate,
Cu<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">8</span>, in hydrogen, when mixed with potassium and cuprous
sulphides or levigated coke, constitutes &ldquo;Abel&rsquo;s fuse,&rdquo; which is used
as a primer. A phosphide, Cu<span class="su">3</span>P<span class="su">2</span>, is formed by passing phosphoretted
hydrogen over heated cuprous chloride. (For other phosphides
see E. Heyn and O. Bauer, <i>Rep. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1906, 3, p. 39.) Cupric
phosphate, Cu<span class="su">3</span>(PO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, may be obtained by precipitating a copper
solution with sodium phosphate. Basic copper phosphates are of
frequent occurrence in the mineral kingdom. Of these we may
notice libethenite, Cu<span class="su">2</span>(OH)PO<span class="su">4</span>; chalcosiderite, a basic copper iron
phosphate; torbernite, a copper uranyl phosphate; andrewsite, a
hydrated copper iron phosphate; and henwoodite, a hydrated copper
aluminium phosphate.</p>

<p>Copper combines directly with arsenic to form several arsenides,
some of which occur in the mineral kingdom. Of these we may
mention whitneyite, Cu<span class="su">9</span>As, algodonite, Cu<span class="su">6</span>As, and domeykite, Cu<span class="su">3</span>As.
Copper arsenate is similar to cupric phosphate, and the resemblance
is to be observed in the naturally occurring copper arsenates,
which are generally isomorphous with the corresponding phosphates.
Olivenite corresponds to libethenite; clinoclase, euchroite, cornwallite
and tyrolite are basic arsenates; zeunerite corresponds to
torbernite; chalcophyllite (tamarite or &ldquo;copper-mica&rdquo;) is a basic
copper aluminium sulphato-arsenate, and bayldonite is a similar
compound containing lead instead of aluminium. Copper arsenite
forms the basis of a number of once valuable, but very poisonous,
pigments. Scheele&rsquo;s green is a basic copper arsenite; Schweinfurt
green, an aceto-arsenite; and Casselmann&rsquo;s green a compound of
cupric sulphate with potassium or sodium acetate.</p>

<p>Normal cupric carbonate, CuCO<span class="su">3</span>, has not been definitely obtained,
basic hydrated forms being formed when an alkaline carbonate is
added to a cupric salt. Copper carbonates are of wide occurrence
in the mineral kingdom, and constitute the valuable ores malachite
and azurite. Copper rust has the same composition as malachite;
it results from the action of carbon dioxide and water on the metal.
Copper carbonate is also the basis of the valuable blue to green
pigments verditer, Bremen blue and Bremen green. Mountain or
mineral green is a naturally occurring carbonate.</p>

<p>By the direct union of copper and silicon, cuprosilicon, consisting
mainly of Cu<span class="su">4</span>Si, is obtained (Lebeau, C.R., 1906; Vigouroux, ibid.).</p>

<p>Copper silicates occur in the mineral kingdom, many minerals
owing their colour to the presence of a cupriferous element. Dioptase
(<i>q.v.</i>) and chrysocolla (<i>q.v.</i>) are the most important forms.</p>

<p><i>Detection.</i>&mdash;Compounds of copper impart a bright green coloration
to the flame of a Bunsen burner. Ammonia gives a characteristic
blue coloration when added to a solution of a copper salt; potassium
ferrocyanide gives a brown precipitate, and, if the solution be very
dilute, a brown colour is produced. This latter reaction will detect
one part of copper in 500,000 of water. For the borax beads and the
qualitative separation of copper from other metals, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chemistry</a></span>:
<i>Analytical</i>. For the quantitative estimation, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Assaying</a></span>:
<i>Copper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Medicine.</i>&mdash;In medicine copper sulphate was employed as an
emetic, but its employment for this purpose is now very rare, as it is
exceedingly depressant, and if it fails to act, may seriously damage
the gastric mucous membrane. It is, however, a useful superficial
caustic and antiseptic. All copper compounds are poisonous, but
not so harmful as the copper arsenical pigments.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPPER-GLANCE,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> a mineral consisting of cuprous sulphide,
Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, and crystallizing in the orthorhombic system. It is known
also as chalcocite, redruthite and vitreous copper (German,
<i>Kupferglaserz</i> of G. Agricola, 1546). The crystals have the form
of six-sided tables or prisms; the
angle between the prism faces
(lettered o in the figure) being
60° 25&prime;. When twinned on the
prism planes o, as is frequently
the case, the crystals simulate
hexagonal symmetry still more
closely, as in the minerals aragonite
and chrysoberyl. Twinning also takes place according
to two other laws, giving rise to interpenetrating crystals with the
basal planes (s) of the two individuals inclined at angles of 69° or
87° 56&prime; respectively. The mineral also occurs as compact masses
of considerable extent. The colour is dark lead-grey with a
metallic lustre, but this is never very bright, since the material
is readily altered, becoming black and dull on exposure to
light. The mineral is soft (H.=2½) and sectile, and can be
readily cut with a knife, like argentite; sp. gr. 5.7. Analyses
agree closely with the formula Cu<span class="su">2</span>S, which corresponds to
79.8% of copper; small quantities of iron and silver are sometimes
present.</p>

<p>Next to chalcopyrite, copper-glance is the most important ore
of copper. It usually occurs in the upper part of the copper-bearing
lodes, and is a secondary sulphide derived from the
chalcopyrite met with at greater depths; sometimes, however,
the two minerals are found together in the same part of the lodes.
The best crystals are from St Just, St Ives, and Redruth in
Cornwall, and from Bristol in Connecticut. Small crystals of
recent formation are found on Roman bronze coins in the thermal
springs at Bourbonne-les-Bains.</p>

<p>Copper-glance readily alters to other minerals, such as
malachite, covellite, melaconite and chalcopyrite. On the other
hand, it is found as pseudomorphs after chalcopyrite, galena, and
organic structures such as wood; copper-glance pseudomorphous
after galena preserves the cleavage of the original mineral and is
known as harrisite.</p>

<p>Isomorphous with copper-glance is the orthorhombic mineral
stromeyerite, a double copper and silver sulphide, CuAgS, which
occurs in abundance in the Altai Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPPERHEADS,<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> an American political epithet, applied by
Union men during the Civil War to those men in the North who,
deeming it impossible to conquer the Confederacy, were earnestly
in favour of peace and therefore opposed to the war policy of the
president and of Congress. Such men were not necessarily
friends of the Confederate cause. The term originated in the
autumn of 1862, and its use quickly spread throughout the North.
In the Western states early in 1863 the terms &ldquo;Copperhead&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
and &ldquo;Democrat&rdquo; had become practically synonymous. The

(CUFeS<span class="su">2</span>), an important ore of copper. The name copper-pyrites
is from the Ger. <i>Kupferkies</i>, which was used as far back as
1546 by G. Agricola; chalcopyrite (from <span class="grk" title="chalkos">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;copper,&rdquo;
and pyrites) was proposed by J. F. Henckel in his <i>Pyritologia,
oder Kiess-Historie</i> (1725). By the ancients copper-pyrites
was included with other minerals under the term pyrites,
though the copper-ore from Cyprus referred to by Aristotle
as chalcites may possibly have been identical with this
mineral.</p>

<p>Chalcopyrite crystallizes in the tetragonal system with inclined
hemihedrism, but the form is so nearly cubic that it was not
recognized as tetragonal until accurate measurements were
made in 1822. Crystals are usually tetrahedral in aspect, owing
to the large development of the sphenoid P {111}. The faces
of this form are dull and striated, whilst the smaller faces of the
complementary sphenoid P&rsquo; {111} (fig. 1) are bright and smooth.
The combination of these two forms produces a figure resembling
an octahedron, the
angle between P and
P&rsquo; being 70° 7½&prime;,
corresponding to the
angle 70° 32&prime; of the
regular octahedron.
The other faces
shown in fig. 1 are
the basal pinacoid,
a {001}, and two
square pyramids,
b {101} and c {201}. Crystals are usually twinned, and are
often complex and difficult to decipher. There are three
twin-laws, the twin-planes being (111), (101) and (110)
respectively. Twinning according to the first law is effected
by rotation about an axis normal to the sphenoidal face (111),
the resulting form resembling the twins of blende and spinel.
Twinning according to the second law can only be explained
by reflection across the plane (101), not by rotation about an
axis; chalcopyrite affords an excellent example of this comparatively
rare type of symmetric twinning. Interpenetration
twins (fig. 2) with (110) as twin-plane are of very rare
occurrence.</p>

<p>Crystals have imperfect cleavages parallel to the eight faces
of the pyramid c {201}. The fracture is conchoidal, and the
material is brittle. Hardness 4; specific gravity 4.2. The
colour is brass-yellow, and the lustre metallic; the streak, or
colour of the powder, is greenish-black. The mineral is especially
liable to surface alteration, tarnishing with beautiful iridescent
colours; a blue colour usually predominates, owing probably
to the alteration of the chalcopyrite to covellite (CuS). The
massive and compact mineral frequently exhibits this iridescent
tarnish, and is consequently known to miners as &ldquo;peacock
ore&rdquo; or &ldquo;peacock copper.&rdquo; The massive mineral sometimes
occurs in mammillary and botryoidal forms with a smooth
brassy surface, and is then known to Cornish miners as &ldquo;blister-copper-ore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chalcopyrite or copper-pyrites may be readily distinguished
from iron-pyrites (or pyrites), which it somewhat resembles
in appearance, by its deeper colour and lower degree of hardness:
the former is easily scratched by a knife, whilst the latter can
only be scratched with difficulty or not at all. Chalcopyrite
is decomposed by nitric acid with separation of sulphur and
formation of a green solution; ammonia added in excess to this
solution changes the green colour to deep blue and precipitates
red ferric hydroxide.</p>

<p>The chemical formula CuFeS<span class="su">2</span> corresponds with the percentage
composition Cu=34.5, Fe=30.5, S=35.0. Analyses usually,
however, show the presence of more iron, owing to the intimate
admixture of iron-pyrites. Traces of gold, silver, selenium or
thallium are sometimes present, and the mineral is sometimes
worked as an ore of gold or silver.</p>

<p>Chalcopyrite is of wide distribution and is the commonest
of the ores of copper. It occurs in metalliferous veins, often
in association with iron-pyrites, chalybite, blende, &amp;c., and in
Cornwall and Devon, where it is abundant, with cassiterite. The
large deposits at Falun in Sweden occur with serpentine in
gneiss, and those at Montecatini, near Volterra in the province
of Pisa, serpentine and gabbro. At Rammelsberg in the Harz
it forms a bed in argillaceous schist, and at Mansfield in Thuringia
it occurs in the Kupferschiefer with ores of nickel and cobalt.
Extensive deposits are mined in the United States, particularly
at Butte in Montana, and in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Well-crystallized specimens are met with at many localities;
for example, formerly at Wheal Towan (hence the name
towanite, which has been applied to the species) in the St
Agnes district of Cornwall, at Freiberg in Saxony, and Joplin,
Missouri.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPROLITES<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="kopros">&#954;&#972;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, dung, and <span class="grk" title="lithos">&#955;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>, stone), the
fossilized excrements of extinct animals. The discovery of
their true nature was made by Dr William Buckland, who
observed that certain convoluted bodies occurring in the Lias
of Gloucestershire had the form which would have been produced
by their passage in the soft state through the intestines of reptiles
or fishes. These bodies had long been known as &ldquo;fossil fir
cones&rdquo; and &ldquo;bezoar stones.&rdquo; Buckland&rsquo;s conjecture that they
were of faecal origin, and similar to the <i>album grecum</i> or excrement
of hyaenas, was confirmed by Dr W. Prout, who on
analysis found they consisted essentially of calcium phosphate
and carbonate, and not infrequently contained fragments of
unaltered bone. The name &ldquo;coprolites&rdquo; was accordingly
given to them by Buckland, who subsequently expressed his
belief that they might be found useful in agriculture on account
of the calcium phosphate they contained. The Liassic coprolites
are described by Buckland as resembling oblong pebbles, or
kidney-potatoes; they are mostly 2 to 4 in. long, and from
1 to 2 in. in diameter, but those of the larger ichthyosauri are
of much greater dimensions. In colour they vary from ash-grey
to black, and their fracture is conchoidal. Internally they are
found to consist of a lamina twisted upon itself, and externally
they generally exhibit a tortuous structure, produced, before
the cloaca was reached, by the spiral valve of a compressed
small intestine (as in skates, sharks and dog-fishes); the surface
shows also vascular impressions and corrugations due to the
same cause. Often the bones, teeth and scales of fishes are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
be found dispersed through the coprolites, and sometimes the
bones of small ichthyosauri, which were apparently a prey to
the larger marine saurians. Coprolites have been found at Lyme
Regis, enclosed by the ribs of ichthyosauri, and in the remains of
several species of fish; also in the abdominal cavities of a species
of fossil fish, <i>Macropoma Mantelli</i>, from the chalk of Lewes.
Professor T. Jäger has described coprolites from the alum-slate
of Gaildorf in Württemberg; the fish-coprolites of Burdiehouse
and of Newcastle-under-Lyme are of Carboniferous age. The
so-called &ldquo;beetle-stones&rdquo; of the coal-formation of Newhaven,
near Leith, which have mostly a coprolite nucleus, have been
applied to various ornamental purposes by lapidaries. The
name &ldquo;cololites&rdquo; (from the Greek <span class="grk" title="kôlon">&#954;&#8183;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>, the large intestine,
<span class="grk" title="lithos">&#955;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>, stone) was given by Agassiz to fossil wormlike bodies,
found in the lithographic slate of Solenhofen, which he determined
to be either the petrified intestines or contents of the intestines
of fishes. The bone-bed of Axmouth in Devonshire and Westbury
and Aust in Gloucestershire, in the Penarth or Rhaetic
series of strata, contains the scales, teeth and bones of saurians
and fishes, together with abundance of coprolites; but neither
there nor at Lyme Regis is there a sufficient quantity of phosphatic
material to render the working of it for agricultural
purposes remunerative.</p>

<p>The term coprolites has been made to include all kinds of
phosphatic nodules employed as manures, such, for example, as
those obtained from the Coralline and the Red Crag of Suffolk.
At the base of the Red Crag in that county is a bed, 3 to 18 in.
thick, containing rolled fossil bones, cetacean and fish teeth, and
shells of the Crag period, with nodules or pebbles of phosphatic
matter derived from the London Clay, and often investing
fossils from that formation. These are distinguishable from
the grey Chalk coprolites by their brownish ferruginous colour
and smooth appearance. When ground they give a yellowish-red
powder. These nodules were at first taken by Professor J. S.
Henslow for coprolites; they were afterwards termed by
Buckland &ldquo;pseudo-coprolites.&rdquo; &ldquo;The nodules, having been
imbued with phosphatic matter from their matrix in the London
Clay, were dislodged,&rdquo; says Buckland, &ldquo;by the waters of the
seas of the first period, and accumulated by myriads at the
bottom of those shallow seas where is now the coast of Suffolk.
Here they were long rolled together with the bones of large
mammalia, fishes, and with the shells of molluscous creatures
that lived in shells. From the bottom of this sea they have been
raised to form the dry lands along the shores of Suffolk, whence
they are now extracted as articles of commercial value, being
ground to powder in the mills of Mr [afterwards Sir John] Lawes,
at Deptford, to supply our farms with a valuable substitute for
guano, under the accepted name of coprolite manure.&rdquo; The
phosphatic nodules occurring throughout the Red Crag of Suffolk
are regarded as derived from the Coralline Crag. The Suffolk
beds have been worked since 1846; and immense quantities of
coprolite have also been obtained from Essex, Norfolk and
Cambridgeshire. The Cambridgeshire coprolites are believed
to be derived from deposits of Gault age; they are obtained by
washing from a stratum about a foot thick, resting on the Gault,
at the base of the Chalk Marl, and probably homotaxeous with
the Chloritic Marl. An acre used to yield on an average 300 tons
of phosphatic nodules, value £750. About £140 per acre was
paid for the lease of the land, which after two years was restored
to its owners re-soiled and levelled. Plicatulae have been found
attached to these coprolites, showing that they were already hard
bodies when lying at the bottom of the Chalk ocean. The
Cambridgeshire coprolites are either amorphous or finger-shaped;
the coprolites from the Greensand are of a black or dark-brown
colour; while those from the Gault are greenish-white on the
surface, brownish-black internally. Samples of Cambridgeshire
and Suffolk coprolite have been found by A. Voelcker to give on
analysis phosphoric acid equivalent to about 55 and 52.5%
of tribasic calcium phosphate respectively (<i>Journ. R. Agric.
Soc. Eng.</i>, 1860, xxi. 358). The following analysis of a saurio-coprolite
from Lyme Regis is given by T. J. Herapath (ibid.
xii. 91):&mdash;</p>

<p>An ichthyo-coprolite from Tenby was found to contain 15.4%
of phosphoric anhydride. The pseudo-coprolites of the Suffolk
Crag have been estimated by Herapath to be as rich in phosphates
as the true ichthyo-coprolites and saurio-coprolites of other
formations, the proportion of P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span> contained varying between
12.5 and 37.25%, the average proportion, however, being 32
or 33%.</p>

<p>Coprolite is reduced to powder by powerful mills of peculiar
construction, furnished with granite and buhrstones, before being
treated with concentrated sulphuric acid. The acid renders it
available as a manure by converting the calcium phosphate,
Ca<span class="su">3</span>P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">8</span>, that it contains into the soluble monocalcium salt,
CaH<span class="su">4</span>P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">8</span>, or &ldquo;superphosphate.&rdquo; The phosphate thus produced
forms an efficacious turnip manure, and is quite equal in value
to that produced from any other source. The Chloritic Marl in
the Wealden district furnishes much phosphatic material, which
has been extensively worked at Froyle. In the vicinity of
Farnham it contains a bed of &ldquo;coprolites&rdquo; of considerable extent
and 2 to 15 ft. in thickness. Specimens of these from the Dippen
Hall pits, analysed by Messrs J. M. Paine and J. T. Way, showed
the presence of phosphates equivalent to 55.96 of bone-earth
(<i>Journ. R. Agric. Soc. Eng.</i> ix. 56). Phosphatic nodules occur
also in the Chloritic Marl of the Isle of Wight and Dorsetshire,
and at Wroughton, near Swindon. They are found in the
Lower Greensand, or Upper Neocomian series, in the Atherfield
Clay at Stopham, near Pulborough; occasionally at the junction
of the Hythe and Sandgate beds; and in the Folkeston beds,
at Farnham. At Woburn, Leighton, Ampthill, Sandy, Upware,
Wicken and Potton, near the base of Upper Neocomian iron-sands,
there is a band between 6 in. and 2 ft. in thickness containing
&ldquo;coprolites&rdquo;; these consist of phosphatized wood,
bones, casts of shells, and shapeless lumps. The coprolitic
stratum of the Speeton Clay, on the coast to the north of Flamborough
Head, is included by Professor Judd with the Portland
beds of that formation. In 1864 two phosphatic deposits, a
limestone 3 ft. thick, with beds of calcium phosphate, and a shale
of half that thickness, were discovered by Hope Jones in the
neighbourhood of Cwmgynen, about 16 m. from Oswestry. They
are at a depth of about 12 ft., in slaty shale containing Llandeilo
fossils and contemporaneous felspathic ash and scoriae. A
specimen of the phosphatic limestone analysed by A. Voelcker
yielded 34.92% tricalcium phosphate, a specimen of the shale
52.15% (<i>Report of Brit. Assoc.</i>, 1865). Phosphatic beds, supposed
to have had a coprolitic origin, are found in the Lower
Silurian rocks of Canada.</p>

with railway station a short distance from the west bank of the
Nile about 25 m. north-east of Thebes), an ancient city, capital of
the fifth nome of Upper Egypt, and the starting-point of several
roads to the Red Sea, of which that which passes along the valley
running due east to Kosseir past the ancient quarries of Hamm&#257;m&#257;t
was the most frequented, until the foundation of Berenice
(<i>q.v.</i>) by Ptolemy Philadelphus made an even more important line
of traffic to the south-west. The growth of trade with Arabia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
and India thereafter raised Coptos to great commercial
prosperity; but in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 292 its share in the rebellion against
Diocletian led to an almost total devastation. It again appears,
however, as a place of importance, and as the seat of a considerable
Christian community, though the stream of traffic turned
aside to the neighbouring &#311;&#363;&#351;. During part of the 7th century
it was called Justinianopolis in honour of the emperor Justinian.</p>

<p>The local god of Coptos, as of Khemmis (Akhm&#299;m, <i>q.v.</i>), was
the ithyphallic Min; but in late times Isis was of equal importance
in the city. Min was especially the god of the desert routes.
Petrie&rsquo;s excavations on the site of the temple brought to light
remains of all periods, the most remarkable objects being three
very primitive limestone statues of the god with figures of an
elephant, swords of sword-fish, sea-shells, &amp;c., engraved upon
them: there were also found some very peculiar terra-cottas of
the Old Kingdom, and the decree of an Antef belonging to the
latter part of the Middle Kingdom, deposing the monarch for
siding with the king&rsquo;s enemy.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPTS,<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> the early native Christians of Egypt and their successors
of the Monophysite sect, now racially the purest representatives
of the ancient Egyptians. The name is a Europeanized
form, dating perhaps from the 14th century, of the Arabic &#311;ibt
(or &#311;ubt), which, in turn, is derived from the Greek <span class="grk" title="Aiguptioi">&#913;&#7984;&#947;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#953;</span>,
&ldquo;Egyptians&rdquo; (the Copts in the Coptic language likewise style
themselves <img style="width:82px; height:20px" src="images/img113.jpg" alt="" />, &ldquo;people of Egypt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Egyptians&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The limited application of the name is explained by the
circumstances of the time when Mahomet sent forth his challenge
to the world and &rsquo;Amr conquered Egypt (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 627-641). At
that time the population of Egypt was wholly Christian (except
for a sprinkling of Jews, &amp;c.), divided into two fiercely hostile
sects, the Monophysites and the Melkites. The division was in
great measure racial. The Melkites, adherents of the orthodox
or court religion sanctioned by the council of Chalcedon, were
mainly of foreign extraction, from the various Hellenistic races
which peopled the Eastern Roman empire, while the bulk of the
population, the true Egyptians, were Monophysite. Amongst
the latter political aspirations, apart from religion, may be said
not to have existed. It has generally been held that the Copts
invited and aided the Moslems to seize the country in order that
at all costs they might be freed from the yoke of the state religion
imposed by the Eastern Roman Empire; but Dr A. J. Butler
has shown this view to be untenable, while admitting that the
religious feuds of the Christians made the task of the Arabs easy.
The mysterious Mu&#311;au&#311;is, who treacherously handed over
Alexandria, impregnable as it was for Arab warriors, and then
capitulated, was none other than Cyrus, the Melkite patriarch
and governor of Egypt; the native Monophysite party, however,
smarting under the persecution of the Emperor Heraclius, seemed
to have most to gain by a change of masters. The prophet
Mahomet himself had prescribed indulgence to the Copts before
his death, and &rsquo;Amr was mercifully disposed to them. Although
they offered resistance in some places, after the Roman forces
had been destroyed or had abandoned Egypt they generally
acquiesced in the inevitable; and when in 646 a Roman fleet
and army recaptured Alexandria and harried the Delta, the
Copts helped the Moslems to cast out the Christian invaders.
Some of the Copts embraced Islam at once, but as yet they
formed practically a solid Christian nation under the protection
of the conquering Arabs, and the religious and political distinction
between the &ldquo;true believers&rdquo; and the Christians was so sharp
that a native Christian turning Moslem was no longer a Copt,
<i>i.e.</i> Egyptian; he practically changed his nationality.</p>

<p>The beginnings of Christianity in Egypt are obscure; the
existence of it among the natives (as opposed to the mixed
&ldquo;Greek&rdquo; population of Egypt and Alexandria which produced
so many leading figures and originated leading doctrines in the
early church) can be traced back as far as the Decian persecution
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 249-251) in the purely Egyptian names of several martyrs.
St Anthony (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 270) was a Copt; so also was Pachomius,
the founder of Egyptian monasticism at the beginning of the
4th century. The scriptures were translated into Coptic not later
than the 4th century. A religion founded on morality and with
a clear doctrine of life after death was especially congenial to
the Egyptians; thus the lower orders in the country embraced
Christianity fervently, while the Alexandrian pagans were lost
in philosophical speculation and Neoplatonism was spread
amongst the rich &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; landowners; these last, partly out
of religious enthusiasm, partly from greed, annoyed and oppressed
their Christian peasantry. Egypt was then terribly impoverished;
the upper country was constantly overrun by
raiders from Nubia and the desert; and the authority of the
imperial government was too weak to interfere actively on
behalf of the Christians. The monasteries, however, were
refuges that could bid defiance to the most powerful of the pagan
aristocracy as well as to barbarian hordes, and became centres
of united action that, at the summons of Shenoute, the organizer
of the national church, swept away the idols of the oppressors
in riot and bloodshed. In the course of the 5th century the
Christians reached a position in which they were able to treat
the pagans mercifully as a feeble remnant.</p>

<p>The Copts had little interest in theology; they were content
to take their doctrine as prepared for them by the subtler minds
of their Greek leaders at Alexandria, choosing the simplest
form when disputes arose. In 325 their elected patriarch,
Athanasius, and his following of Greeks and Copts, triumphed
at the council of Nicaea against Arius; but in 451 the banishment
of Dioscorus, patriarch of Alexandria, by the council of Chalcedon
created a great schism, the Egyptian church holding to his
Monophysite tenets (see <i>Coptic Church</i>, below), while the Catholic
and imperial party at Constantinople ever sought to further
the &ldquo;Melkite&rdquo; cause in Egypt at the expense of the native church.
Thenceforward there were generally two patriarchs, belonging
to the rival communities, and the Copts were oppressed by the
Melkites; Heraclius, in 638 after the repulse of the Persians,
endeavoured to unite the churches, but, failing in that, he
persecuted the Monophysites more severely than ever before,
until &lsquo;Amr brought Egypt under the Moslem rule of &rsquo;Omar, as
has been related above. Under the persecution many Copts
had gone over to the Melkites, but now it was the turn of the
Melkites, as supporters of the emperor of Constantinople, to
suffer, and they almost entirely disappeared from Egypt, though
a remnant headed by a patriarch of Alexandria of the Orthodox
Christians has survived to this day.</p>

<p>But after a few years of the mild rule of &lsquo;Amr the Egyptians
began to be squeezed for the benefit of the Moslem exchequer and
persecuted for their religion. Many of the more thoughtful and
sober Christians must long have been disgusted with religious
strife, and had already embraced the simple and congenial
doctrines of Islam; others went over for the sake of material gain.
Conflicts arose from time to time between the Mahommedan
minority and the Christians. The Copts were excellent scribes
and accountants and were continued in their posts under the
Arab rule; the government offices were full of them; sometimes
even the wazirate (vizierate) was held by a Copt, and that too in a
time of persecution of the Christians. The pride of the Copts,
still seen in the objection which the poorest among them have
to engaging in any mean work or trade, was a serious danger,
perhaps even a chief source of their troubles, in earlier days;
devout Moslems on more than one occasion stirred the mob to
fury when they saw Christians lording it over &ldquo;true believers.&rdquo;
The lower orders of the Copts were continually oppressed. Thus
there was every inducement amongst the Christians to turn
Mahommedan. Arab tribes, too, were encouraged to settle in
Egypt until the Mahommedans exceeded the Copts in numbers.</p>

<p>The history of the Copts consists on the one hand of the record
of religious strife, of growing scandals in the church, such as
simony, and attempted reforms; and on the other hand of
persecutions at the hands of the Moslems. As examples of the
severity of the persecutions, it may be noted that, in the 8th
century, the monks not only were compelled to pay a capitation
tax, but were branded with name and number, civilians were
oppressed with heavy taxation, churches demolished, pictures and
crosses destroyed (722-723). Degrading dresses were imposed
upon the Christians (849-850); later, under Hakim (997), they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
were compelled to wear heavy crosses and black turbans as
an ignominious distinction. Salaheddin (Saladin) in 1171 reenforced
these statutes and defiled the churches. In 1301, the
blue turban was introduced, but many Copts preferred a change
of religion to the adoption of this head-dress. In 1348 a religious
war, attended by the destruction of churches and mosques and
great loss of life, raged at Cairo between the Copts and Mahommedans,
and large numbers of the former embraced Islam.
Their oppression practically ceased under Mehemet Ali (1811).</p>

<p>There have been very few cases of conversion from Mahommedanism
to Christianity; and, as intermarriage of Christians
with Mahommedans implied conversion to Islam, the Copts have
undoubtedly preserved the race of the Egyptians as it existed at
the time of the Arab conquest in remarkable purity. The Coptic
agricultural population (fellah&#299;n) in the villages of Upper Egypt
and elsewhere are not markedly different from the Mahommedan
fellah&#299;n, who, of course, are of the same stock, but mixed with
Arab blood. The Copts in the towns, who have always been
engaged in sedentary occupations, as scribes and handicraftsmen,
have a more delicate frame and complexion, and may have
mingled with Syrian and Armenian Christians.</p>

<p>According to the 1907 census, there were 667,036 orthodox
Copts in Egypt, or less than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">14</span>th of the total population, this
being the same proportion as in 1830, when, according to Lane,
they numbered about 150,000. The number of churches and
monasteries at the same time had risen from 146 to 450, not
including Protestant chapels nor Coptic Catholic churches. At
the 1907 census the total number of Christians in Egypt described
as Copts was 706,322; among them there were 24,710 Protestants
and 14,576 Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Monogamy is strict among the Copts, and divorce is granted
only for adultery. Circumcision of both sexes is common before
baptism. In regard to dress, at present only the clergy retain
the old distinctive costume and black turban. The rest of the
Copts dress exactly like their Moslem brethren, from whom
they can be distinguished only by the cross which many of them
still have tattooed just below the palm of the right hand. Since
the British occupation of the country there has been a tendency
amongst the Coptic women to give up the veil, which they had
borrowed from the Mahommedans; this is especially noticeable
at places like Assiût, where, thanks to the efforts of American
missionaries, female education has made much progress.</p>

<p>In trades and professions, so long as the Copts had no foreign
competition to contend against, they maintained their supremacy
over the rest of the population. They filled government offices;
in towns and villages they monopolized trades and professions
requiring care and skill. They were the accountants, the
architects, the goldsmiths, the carpenters, the land-surveyors, the
bonesetters, &amp;c. But, with the extension of railways and
agricultural roads and the increased facilities of communication
and prosperity, there has been a great influx of Italian, Greek,
Armenian and other Levantine workmen, who, with their better
tools, are undoubtedly superior to the Copts, and have proved
most formidable rivals. Furthermore, the importation of cheap
European wares of every description is slowly killing all native
industry. Lastly, since the British, as the dominant race, have
filled most posts of responsibility in the government, the Moslems,
in general, are obliged to content themselves with the subordinate
posts which in the past they left to the Copts. Some
Copts have attained high office, and in 1908 a Copt became prime
minister. Moreover, the Copts have to a certain extent made up
for the ground they lose elsewhere by engaging in agriculture
and banking, and there are now to be found many rich Coptic
landowners and farmers, especially in Upper Egypt.</p>

<p><i>Language.</i>&mdash;The language spoken by the Copts was of various
dialects, named Sahidic, Akhmimic, Fayumic, &amp;c., descended
from the ancient Egyptian with more or less admixture of Greek
(for the Coptic dialects see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Egypt</a></span>: <i>Language</i>). Coptic, however,
has been entirely extinct as a spoken language for over 200 years,
having been supplanted by Arabic; in the 13th century it was
already so much decayed that Arabic translations of the liturgies
were necessary. The Gospels, however, are still read in the
churches in the Bohairic dialect. This dialect appears in literature
later than the others, having become of importance only
with the extinction of Greek in Lower Egypt; for a time it shared
the field with Sahidic, after the disappearance of Akhmimic and
Fayumic, but eventually displaced it in the churches, where it now
survives alone.</p>

<p>Coptic literature is almost entirely religious, and consists
mainly of translations from the Greek. Such was the enthusiasm
for Christianity amongst the lower classes in Egypt that translations
of the Bible were made into three of the dialects of Coptic
before the council of Chalcedon; they probably date back at
least as early as the middle of the 4th century. For the dwellers
in the Delta the Greek version was probably sufficient, until the
break with the Greek (Melkite) Church in the 5th century
induced them to make a separate translation in their own native
northern or Bohairic dialect. The Gnostic heresy, otherwise
known only through the works of its opponents, is illustrated
in some Coptic MSS. of the 4th century, the so-called <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> or Askew Codex, and the Bruce Codex, respectively in
the British Museum and Bodleian Libraries. According to
Schmidt and Harnack, they are translations dating from the
3rd century and belong to an ascetic or encratitic sect of the
Gnostics which arose in Egypt itself. There is abundance of
apocryphal works, of apocalypses, of patristic writings from
Athanasius to the council of Chalcedon, homilies, lives of saints
and anecdotes of holy men, acts of martyrs extending from the
persecution of Diocletian to that of the Persians in the 7th
century, and lives of later ascetics and martyrs reaching down
to the 14th century. Unless some of the Egyptian <i>acta sanctorum
et martyrum</i> should prove to have been originally written in
Coptic, almost the only original works in that language of any
importance are the numerous sermons and letters of Shenoute,
a monk of Atr&#275;pe near Akhm&#299;m, written in the Sahidic dialect
in the 4th century. After the Arab conquest, as a defence to
the threatened church, language and nationality, versifications
of the Proverbs, of Solomon&rsquo;s Song and of various legends were
composed, with other religious songs. They are mostly antiphonal,
a number of stresses in a line marking the rhythm.
There is no musical notation in the MSS., but traditional church
tunes are generally referred to or prescribed for the songs. Of
secular literature strangely little existed or at least has survived:
only a few magical texts, fragments of a medical treatise, of the
story of Alexander, and of a story of the conquest of Egypt by
Cambyses, are known, apart from numerous legal and business
documents.</p>

<p>Coptic was occasionally employed for literary purposes as
late as the 14th century, but from the 10th century onward
the Copts wrote mostly in Arabic. Severus of Eshmunain (c. 950),
who wrote a history of the patriarchs of Alexandria, was one of
the first to employ Arabic; Cyril ibn Laklak and others in the
13th and 14th centuries translated much of the older literature
from Coptic into Arabic and Ethiopic for the use of the Egyptian
and Abyssinian churches. From this period also date the native
Coptic grammars and lexicons of Ibn &rsquo;Assal and others. At
the present time literature among the Copts is represented by
Claudius Lab&#299;b, an enthusiast for the revival of the Coptic
tongue, Marcus Simaika, a leader of the progressive movement,
and others.</p>
<div class="author">(F. Ll. G.)</div>

<p><i>The Coptic Church.</i>&mdash;Up to the 5th century the church of
Alexandria played a part in the Christian world scarcely second
to that of Rome: the names of Origen, Athanasius and Cyril
bear witness to her greatness. But in the time of the patriarch
Dioscorus the church, always fond of speculation, was rent
asunder by the controversy concerning the single or twofold nature
of our Lord, as stated by Eutyches. The Eutychian doctrine,
approved by the council of Ephesus, was condemned by that
of Chalcedon in 451. But to this decision, though given by 636
bishops, the Copts refused assent&mdash;a refusal which profoundly
affected both the religious and the political history of their
country. From that moment they were treated as heretics.
The emperor appointed a new bishop of Alexandria, whose
adherents the Copts styled Melkites or Imperialists, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
Copts are distinguished as Monophysites and Jacobites. The
court party and the native party each maintained its own line
of patriarchs, and each treated the other with bitter hostility.
For nearly two centuries strife and persecution continued.
The well-meant ecthesis of Heraclius was a failure and was
followed by repression, till in 640 the Copts were released from
the Roman dominion by the Saracen invasion. But it was only
after prolonged resistance to the Arabs that the Copts accepted a
change of masters, which gave them for a while religious freedom.
The orthodox or Melkite party, consisting mostly of Byzantine
Greeks, was swept away, and the double succession of patriarchs
practically ceased. True, even now there is an orthodox
patriarch of Alexandria living in Cairo, but he has only a few
Greeks for followers, and scarcely a nominal succession has been
maintained. But the Coptic succession has been continuous and
real.</p>

<p>The distinctive Monophysite doctrine of the Copts is not easy
to state intelligibly, and yet they cling to it with something of
the tenacity which has marked their whole history.
They repudiate the heresy of Eutyches as strongly
<span class="sidenote">Doctrine.</span>
as that of Nestorius, and claim to stand between the two doctrines
teaching that Christ was one person with one nature which was
made up by the indissoluble union of a divine and a human
nature, but that notwithstanding this absolute union the two
natures remained after union distinct, unconfounded and
uncommingled, separate though inseparable. The creed thus
savours of paradox, not to say contradiction. It is set forth in
the Liturgy and recited at every Coptic mass in the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;I believe that this is the life-giving flesh which thine
only Son took from the ... Holy Mary. He united it with
His Divinity without mingling and without confusion and without
alteration.... I believe that His Divinity was not separated
from His Manhood for one moment or for the twinkling of an
eye.&rdquo; On all other points of dogma, including the single procession
of the Holy Ghost, the Copts agree with the Greek
Church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most holy pope and patriarch of the great city of
Alexandria and of all the land of Egypt, of Jerusalem the holy
city, of Nubia, Abyssinia and Pentapolis, and all the
preaching of St Mark,&rdquo; as he is still called, had originally
<span class="sidenote">Hierarchy.</span>
jurisdiction over all the places named. Jurisdiction over
Abyssinia remains, but from Nubia and Pentapolis Christianity
has disappeared. The ancient rule is that no bishop is eligible
for the patriarchate. The requirement of a period of desert life
has so far prevailed that no one but a monk from one of the
desert monasteries is now qualified. This rule, harmless perhaps
when the monasteries were the great schools of learning and
devotion, now puts a premium on ignorance, and is disastrous
to the church; more particularly as even bishops must be chosen
from the monks. The patriarch is elected by an assembly of
bishops and elders. The candidate is brought in chains from
the desert, and, if only in monk&rsquo;s orders, is passed through
the higher grades except that of bishop. The patriarch&rsquo;s seat
was transferred some time after the Arab conquest from Alexandria
to the fortress town of Babylon (Old Cairo), and in modern
times it was shifted to Cairo proper. The other orders and offices
in the church are metropolitan, bishop, chief priest, priest,
archdeacon, deacon, reader and monk. The number of bishoprics
in ancient times was very large&mdash;Athanasius says nearly 100. At
present there remain ten in Egypt, one at Khartum and three
in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The numerous remaining churches in Egypt but faintly
represent the vast number standing in ancient times. Rufinus
says that he found 10,000 monks in the one region
of Arsinoe. Later, in 616, the Persians are described
<span class="sidenote">Buildings.</span>
as destroying 600 monasteries near Alexandria. Ab&#363; S&#257;lih
(12th century) gives a list of churches surviving in his day, and
their number is astonishing. The earliest were cut out of rocks
and caverns. In the days of Constantine and Justinian basilicas
of great splendour were built, such as the church of St Mark
at Alexandria and the Red Monastery in Upper Egypt. This
type of architecture permanently influenced Coptic builders,
but there prevailed also a type, probably native in origin, though
possessing Byzantine features, such as the domed roofing.
There is no church now standing which bears any trace of the
fine glass mosaics which once adorned the basilicas, nor is there
any example of a well-defined cruciform ground-plan. But the
use of the dome by Coptic architects is almost universal, and
nearly every church has at least three domes overshadowing
the three altars. The domes are sometimes lighted by small
windows; but the walls are windowless, and the churches consequently
gloomy. Among the most interesting churches are
those of Old Cairo, those in the Wadi Natron, and the Red and
White Monasteries (<i>Der el-Abiad</i> and <i>Der el-Ahmar</i>) near
Suhag in Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>Every church has three altars at the eastern end in three
contiguous chapels. The central division is called the <i>haikal</i>
or sanctuary, which is always divided from the choir
by a fixed partition or screen with a small arched
<span class="sidenote">Church fittings.</span>
doorway closed by double doors. This resembles
the Greek iconostasis, the screen on which the &ldquo;icons&rdquo; or
sacred pictures are placed. <i>Haikal</i> screen and choir screen
are often sumptuously carved and inlaid. A marble basin for
the mandatum in the nave, and an epiphany tank at the west
are common features. The altar is usually built of brick or
stone, hollow within, and having an opening to the interior.
A wooden altar-slab covered with crosses, &amp;c., lies in a rectangular
depression on the surface, and it is used in case of need as a
portable altar. Chalice and paten, ewer and basin, crewet and
chrismatory, are found as in the Western churches. The aster
consists of two crossed half-hoops of silver and is used to place
over the wafer. The flabellum is used, though now rarely made
of precious metal. Some examples of silver-cased textus now
remaining are very fine. Every church possesses thuribles&mdash;the
use of incense being universal and frequent&mdash;and diadems
for the marriage service. The use of church bells is forbidden
by the Moslems, except in the desert, and church music consists
merely of cymbals and triangles which accompany the chanting.</p>

<p>The sacramental wine is usually made from raisins, but the
juice must be fermented. Churches even in Cairo have a press
for crushing the raisins. The eucharistic bread is baked
in an oven built near the sanctuary. The wafer is
<span class="sidenote">Rites and ceremonies.</span>
a small loaf about 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch
thick, stamped with the trisagion and with crosses.
Communion must be received fasting. Confession is required,
but has somewhat fallen into disuse. Laymen receive in both
kinds. The wafer being broken into the chalice, crumbs or
&ldquo;pearls&rdquo; are taken out in a spoon and so administered, as in
the Greek rite. Reservation is uncanonical. Renaudot states
that it was permitted in cases of great extremity, when the host
remained upon the altar with lamps burning and a priest watching,
but it is not now practised, and there is no evidence of any such
vessel as a pyx in Coptic ritual. Small benedictional crosses
belong to each altar, and processional crosses are common. The
crucifix is unknown, for while paintings and frescoes abound,
graven images are absolutely forbidden. The liturgy was read
exclusively in the extinct Coptic language till the end of the
19th century, but parts are now read in Arabic, while the lessons
have long been read in Arabic as well as in Coptic. The services
are still excessively long, that of Good Friday lasting eleven
hours; but benches are now provided in the newer churches.
Seven sacraments are recognized&mdash;baptism, confirmation,
eucharist, penance, orders, matrimony, and unction of the sick.
The chief fasts are those of Advent, of Nineveh, of Heraclius,
Lent and Pentecost. Pilgrimage to Jerusalem is a duty and
sometimes a penance.</p>

<p>The Coptic ritual deserves much fuller study than it has
received. Since the 7th century the church has been so isolated
as to be little influenced by changes affecting other communions.
Consequently it remains in many respects the most ancient
monument of primitive rites and ceremonies in Christendom.
But centuries of subjection to Moslem rule have much weakened
it. For the liturgical dress see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chasuble</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The British occupation of Egypt profoundly modified Coptic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
religious life. Before it the Copts lived in their own semi-fortified
quarters in Cairo or Old Cairo or in country or desert
<span class="sidenote">Present state of the church.</span>
Dairs (Ders). Walls and gates were now thrown
down or disused: the Copts began to mix and live
freely among the Moslems, their children to frequent
the same schools, and the people to abandon their
distinctively Christian dress, names, customs and even religion.
Freedom and prosperity threatened to injure the Church more
than centuries of persecution. Many of the younger generation
of Copts began openly to boast their indifference and even
scepticism: in the large towns churches came to be too often
frequented only by the old or the uneducated, confession and
fasts fell into neglect and the number of communicants
diminished; while the facility of divorce granted by Islam
occasioned many perversions from among the Copts to that
religion. On the other hand the necessity of resistance to these
tendencies and of reform from within was strongly realized.
Unfortunately, the institution of a lay council of eminent
churchmen, which has been formed for the patriarch and for
every bishop in his own diocese, has led to prolonged struggles
and on one occasion to a serious crisis, in which the patriarch
and the metropolitan of Alexandria were for a while banished
to the desert. A principal object of these lay councils is to
control the financial and legal powers vested in patriarch and
bishops&mdash;powers which have often been greatly abused. Other
objects are (1) to provide Christian religious education in all
Coptic schools and to raise these schools to a high standard in
secular matters; (2) to promote the education of women; (3)
to apply church revenues to the maintenance of churches and
schools and to the better payment of the clergy, who are now
often compelled to live on charity; (4) to ensure prompt administration
of justice in ecclesiastical causes such as divorce,
inheritance, &amp;c.; and (5) to establish colleges for the efficient
training of the clergy. Educated Copts remember the time
when the church of Alexandria was as famous for learning as
for zeal. They desire also to resist the serious encroachments
of Roman Catholic, American Presbyterian, and other foreign
missions upon their ancient faith.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPYHOLD,<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> in English law, an ancient form of land tenure,
legally defined as a &ldquo;holding at the will of the lord according
to the custom of the manor.&rdquo; Though nowadays of diminishing
practical importance, its incidents are historically interesting.
Its origin is to be found in the occupation by villani, or non-freemen,
of portions of land belonging to the manor of a feudal
lord. In the time of the Domesday survey the manor was in part
granted to free tenants, in part reserved by the lord himself
for his own uses. The estate of the free tenants is the freehold
estate of English law; as tenants of the same manor they
assembled together in manorial court or court baron, of which
they were the judges. The portion of the manor reserved for
the lord (the <i>demesne</i>, or domain) was cultivated by labourers
who were bound to the land (<i>adscripti glebae</i>). They could not
leave the manor, and their service was obligatory. These villani,
however, were allowed by the lord to cultivate portions of land
for their own use. It was a mere occupation at the pleasure of
the lord, but in course of time it grew into an occupation by
right, recognized first of all by custom and afterwards by law.
This kind of tenure is called by the lawyers <i>villenagium</i>, and it
probably marks a great advance in the general recognition of
the right when the name is applied to lands held on the same conditions
not by villeins but by free men. The tenants in villenage
were not, like the freeholders, members of the court baron, but
they appear to have attended in a humbler capacity, and to have
solicited the succession to the land occupied by a deceased father,
or the admission of a new tenant who had purchased the goodwill,
as it might be called, of the holding, paying for such favours
certain customary fines or dues. In relation to the tenants in
villenage, the court baron was called the customary court. The
records of the court constituted the title of the villein tenant,
held by copy of the court roll (whence the term &ldquo;copyhold&rdquo;);
and the customs of the manor therein recorded formed the real
property law applicable to his case.</p>

<p>Copyhold had long been established in practice before it was
formally recognized by the law. At first it was in fact, as it is
now in the fictitious theory of the law, a tenancy at will, for which
none of the legal remedies of a freeholder were available. In the
reign of Edward IV., however, it was held that a tenant in
villenage had an action of trespass against the lord. In this way
a species of tenant-right, depending on and strongly supported
by popular opinion, was changed into a legal right. But it retained
many incidents characteristic of its historical origin. The life of
copyhold assurance, it is said, is custom. Copyhold is necessarily
parcel of a manor, and the freehold is said to be in the lord of
the manor. The court roll of the manor is the evidence of title
and the record of the special laws as to fines, quit rents, heriots,
&amp;c., prevailing in the manor. When copyhold land is conveyed
from one person to another, it is surrendered by the owner to the
lord, who by his payment of the customary fine makes a new
grant of it to the purchaser. The lord must admit the vendor&rsquo;s
nominee, but the form of the conveyance is still that of surrender
and re-grant. The lord, as legal owner of the fee-simple of the
lands, has a right to all the mines and minerals and to all the
growing timber, although the tenant may have planted it himself.
Hence it appears that the existence of copyhold tenures may
sometimes be traced by the total absence of timber from such
lands, while on freehold lands it grows in abundance. Hence
also the popular saying that the &ldquo;oak grows not except on free
land.&rdquo; The copyholder must not commit waste either by cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
down timber, &amp;c., or by neglecting to repair buildings. In such
respects the law treats him as a mere lessee,&mdash;the real owner
being supposed to be the lord. On the other hand, the lord
may not enter the land to cut his own timber or open his mines.
The limitations of estates usual in respect of other lands, as found
in copyhold, become subject of course to the operations of its
peculiar conditions as to the relation of lord and tenant. An
estate for life, or <i>pour autre vie</i> (<i>i.e.</i> for another&rsquo;s life), an estate
entail, or in fee-simple, may be carved out of copyhold.</p>

<p>A species of tenure resembling copyhold is what is known as
<i>customary freehold</i>. The land is held by copy of court-roll, but
not by will of the lord. The question has been raised whether
the freehold of such lands is in the lord of the manor or in the
tenant, and the courts of law have decided in favour of the former.
In some instances copyhold for lives alone is recognized, and in
such cases the lord of the manor may ultimately, when all the
lives have dropped, get back the land into his own hands.</p>

<p>The feudal obligations attaching to copyhold tenure have
been found to cause much inconvenience to the tenants, while
they are of no great value to the lord. One of the most vexatious
of these is the <i>heriot</i>, under which name the lord is entitled to
seize the tenant&rsquo;s best beast or other chattel in the event of the
tenant&rsquo;s death. The custom dates from the time when all the
copyholder&rsquo;s property, including the copyholder himself, belonged
to the lord, and is supposed to have been fixed by way of analogy
to the custom which gave a military tenant&rsquo;s habiliments to
his lord in order to equip his successor. Instances have occurred
of articles of great value being seized as heriots for the copyhold
tenements of their owners. A race horse worth £2000 or £3000
was thus seized. The fine payable on the admission of a new
tenant, whether by alienation or succession, is to a certain extent
arbitrary, but the courts long ago laid down the rule that it must
be reasonable, and anything beyond two years&rsquo; improved value
of the lands they disallowed.</p>

<p>The inconvenience caused by these feudal incidents of the
tenure led to a series of statutes, having for their object the
conversion of copyhold into freehold. The first Copyhold Act,
that of 1841, was consolidated by the Copyhold Act 1894.
Owing to the incidents attaching to land &ldquo;holden by copy of
court roll according to the custom of the manor&rdquo; in the shape of
fines and heriots, the inability to grant a lease for a term exceeding
a year, and to the peculiar rules as to descent, waste, dower,
curtesy, alienation, and other matters, varying often from manor
to manor and widely differing from the uniform law applicable
to land in general, enfranchisement, or the conversion of land
held by copyhold tenure into freehold, is often desired. This could
and may still be effected at common law, but only by agreement
on the part of both the lord and the tenant. Moreover, it was
subject to other disadvantages. The cost fell on the tenant, and
the land when enfranchised was subject to the encumbrances
attaching to the manor, and so an investigation into the lord&rsquo;s
title was necessary. In 1841 an act was passed to provide a
statutory method of enfranchisement, removing some of the
barriers existing at common law; but the machinery created
was only available where both lord and tenant were in agreement.
The Copyhold Act 1852 went further, and for the first time
introduced the principle of compulsory enfranchisement on the
part of either party. By the Copyhold Act 1894, which now
governs statutory enfranchisement, the former Copyhold Acts
1841-1887, were repealed, and the law was consolidated and
improved. Enfranchisement is now effected under this act,
though in certain cases it is also to be obtained under special
acts, such as the Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1848; and the
old common law method with all its disadvantages is still open.
The Copyhold Act 1894 deals both with compulsory and with
voluntary enfranchisement. In either case the sanction of the
Board of Agriculture must be obtained; and powers are bestowed
on it to decide questions arising on enfranchisement, with an
appeal to the High Court. The actual enfranchisement, where
it is compelled by one of the parties, is effected by an award
made by the board; in the case of a voluntary enfranchisement
it is completed by deed. Under the act it is open to both lord
and tenant to compel enfranchisement, though the expenses are
to be borne by the party requiring it. The compensation to
the lord, in the absence of an agreement, is ascertained under the
direction of the board on a valuation made by a valuer or
valuers appointed by the lord and tenant; and may be paid
either in a gross sum or by way of an annual rent charge issuing
out of the land enfranchised, and equivalent to interest at the
rate of 4% on the amount fixed upon as compensation. This
rent charge is redeemable on six months&rsquo; notice at twenty-five
times its annual amount. The tenant, even if he is the compelling
party, may elect either method; but the lord has not the same
option, and where the enfranchisement is at his instance, unless
there is either an agreement to the contrary or a notice on the
part of the tenant to exercise his option, the compensation is
a rent charge. Power is conferred on the lord to purchase the
tenant&rsquo;s interest where a change in the condition of the land by
enfranchisement would prejudice his mansion house, park or
gardens; while on the other hand, in the interest of the public
or the other tenants, the board is authorized to continue conditions
of user for their benefit.</p>

<p>So far the provisions relating to compulsory enfranchisement
have been dealt with; but even in the case of a voluntary agreement
the lord and tenant are only entitled to accept enfranchisement
with the consent of the Board of Agriculture. The
consideration in addition to a gross sum or a rent charge may
consist of a conveyance of land, or of a right to mines or minerals,
or of a right to waste in lands belonging to the manor, or partly
in one way and partly in another. The effect of enfranchisement,
whether it be voluntary or compulsory, is that the land becomes
of freehold tenure subject to the same laws relating to descent,
dower and curtesy as are applicable to freeholds, and so freed
from Borough English, Gavelkind (save in Kent), and other customary
modes of descent, and from any custom relating to dower
or free-bench or tenancy by curtesy. Nevertheless, the lord is
entitled to escheat in the event of failure of heirs, just as if the land
had not been enfranchised. The land is held under the same title
as that under which it was held at the date at which the enfranchisement
takes effect; but it is not subject to any estate right,
charge, or interest affecting the manor. Every mortgage of
copyhold estate in the land enfranchised becomes a mortgage
of the freehold, though subject to the priority of the rent charge
paid in compensation under the act. All rights and interests of
any person in the land and all leases remain binding in the same
manner. On the other hand the tenant&rsquo;s rights of common still
continue attached to the freehold; and, without express consent
in writing of the lord or tenant respectively, the right of either
in mines or minerals shall not be affected by the change. No
creation of new copyholds by granting land out of the waste is
permissible, save with the consent of the Board of Agriculture;
and the act enacts that a valid admittance of a new copyholder
may be made without holding a court.</p>

<p>Under the earlier acts, machinery to free the land from the
burden of the old rents, fines and heriots was set up, commuting
them into a rent charge or a fine. Commutation, however, is
never compulsory, and differs from enfranchisement in that,
whereas by enfranchisement the land in question is converted
into freehold, by commutation it still continued parcel of the
manor, though subject to a rent charge or a fine, as might have
been agreed. The ordinary laws of descent, dower, and curtesy
were, however, substituted for the customs in relation to these
matters incidental to the land in question before commutation,
and the timber became the tenant&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="bold">COPYING MACHINES.<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> Appliances of various kinds have
been devised for producing copies of writings made by the pen
or pencil. A simple method commonly adopted when only a
single copy is required is to write the original with specially
prepared copying ink (formed by adding some thickening
substance like sugar or gum to ordinary ink), to place upon it a
damped sheet of thin absorbent paper, and to press the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
together in some way, as in a copying press. The resulting
impression, being reversed, must be read from the back of the
absorbent paper, which is thin enough to be transparent.
Another process, by which a considerable number of copies
can be made simultaneously, consists in interleaving a number
of sheets of thin white paper with sheets of paper prepared with
lampblack (&ldquo;carbon paper&rdquo;) and writing on the top sheet
with a &ldquo;style&rdquo; or other sharp-pointed instrument. The
hectograph may be taken as typical of manifolding processes
analogous to lithography. In it the writing is in first instance
done with aniline ink, and then a transfer is made to a plate of
a gelatinous composition, from which a series of duplicates can
be taken off. Another class of methods involves the preparation
of what are essentially stencils. In the cyclostyle, paper of a
special kind is stretched over a smooth metal plate, and the
writing instrument consists of a holder having at the end a
small wheel provided with a serrated edge on its periphery,
which perforates the paper with lines of minute cuts and thus
forms a stencil. When ink is passed over this stencil with a roller
it goes through the perforations and leaves an impression on a
piece of paper placed underneath. In the trypograph a similar
result is attained by using a simple style for writing, but stretching
the paper over a metal plate having its surface covered with
fine sharp corrugations which pierce the paper as the style is
moved over them. In the Edison electric pen the stencil is
formed by the aid of a style containing a fine needle, which is
rapidly moved up and down by a small electric motor mounted
at the top of the pen, and thus a series of minute holes is
punctured in the paper by the act of writing. For copying plans
and drawings, engineers, architects, &amp;c., use a &ldquo;blue print&rdquo;
process which depends on the action of light on certain salts of
iron (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sun-Copying</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Photography</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">COPYRIGHT,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> in law, the right, belonging exclusively to
the author or his assignees, of multiplying for sale copies of an
original work or composition, in literature or art. As a recognized
form of property it is, compared with others, of recent origin,
being in fact, in the use of literary works, mainly the result of the
facility for multiplying copies created by the discovery of printing.
It is with copyright in literary compositions that we are here
primarily concerned, as it was established first, the analogous
right as regards works of plastic art, &amp;c., following in its train.</p>

<p>1. Whether copyright was recognized at all by the common
law of England was long a much debated legal question. Blackstone
thinks that &ldquo;this species of property, being grounded on
labour and invention, is more properly reducible to the head of
occupancy than any other, since the right of occupancy itself
is supposed by Mr Locke and many others to be founded on the
personal labour of the occupant.&rdquo; But he speaks doubtfully of
its existence&mdash;merely mentioning the opposing views, &ldquo;that
on the one hand it hath been thought no other man can have a
right to exhibit the author&rsquo;s work without his consent, and that
it is urged on the other hand that the right is of too subtle and
unsubstantial a nature to become the subject of property at
the common law, and only capable of being guarded by positive
statutes and special provisions of the magistrate.&rdquo; He notices
that the Roman law adjudged that if one man wrote anything
on the paper or parchment of another, the writing should belong
to the owner of the blank materials, but as to any other property
in the works of the understanding the law is silent, and he adds
that &ldquo;neither with us in England hath there been (till very lately)
any final determination upon the rights of authors at the common
law.&rdquo; The common law undoubtedly gives a right to restrain
the publication of <i>unpublished</i> compositions; but when a work
is once published, its protection depends on the statutes regulating
copyright. The leading case on the subject of unpublished
works is <i>Prince Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i> (1849), 2 De G. &amp; Sm. 652.
Copies of etchings by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, which
had been lithographed for private circulation, fell into the hands
of the defendant, a London publisher, who proposed to exhibit
them, and issued a catalogue entitled <i>A Descriptive Catalogue
of the Royal Victoria and Albert Gallery of Etchings</i>. The court
of chancery restrained the publication of the catalogue, holding
that property in mechanical works, or works of art, does certainly
subsist, and is invaded, before publication, not only by copying
but by description or catalogue. This protection includes news
(<i>Exchange Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Central News</i>, 1897).</p>

<p>As a matter of principle, the nature of copyright itself, and the
reasons why it should be recognized in law, have, as already
stated, been the subject of bitter dispute. It was
attacked as constituting a monopoly, and it has been
<span class="sidenote">Nature of right.</span>
argued that copyright should be looked upon as a
doubtful exception to the general law regulating trade, and should
be strictly limited in point of duration. On the other hand, it is
claimed that copyright, being in the nature of personal property,
should be perpetual. A man&rsquo;s own work, in this view, is as much
<i>his</i> as his house or his money, and should be protected by the
state. Historically, and in legal definition, there would appear
to be no doubt that copyright, as regulated by statute, is strictly
a monopoly. The parliamentary protection of works of art for
the period of fourteen years by an act of 1709 and later statutes
appears, as Blackstone points out, to have been suggested by
the exception in the Statute of Monopolies 1623. The object of
that statute was to suppress the royal grants of exclusive right to
trade in certain articles, and to reassert in relation to all such
monopolies the common law of the land. Certain exceptions
were made on grounds of public policy, and among others it was
allowed that a royal patent of privilege might be granted for
fourteen years &ldquo;to any inventor of a new manufacture for the
sole working or making of the same.&rdquo; Copyright, like patent
right, would be covered by the legal definition of a monopoly.
It is a mere right to prevent other people from manufacturing
certain articles. But objections to monopolies in general do
not apply to this particular class of cases, in which the author
of a new work in literature or art has the right of preventing
others from manufacturing copies thereof and selling them to
the public. The rights of persons licensed to sell spirits, to hold
theatrical exhibitions, &amp;c., are also of the nature of monopolies,
and may be defended on special grounds of public policy. The
monopoly of authors and inventors rests on the general sentiment
underlying all civilized law, that a man should be protected in
the enjoyment of the fruits of his own labour.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">Literary Copyright</p>

<p>2. <i>United Kingdom.</i>&mdash;On the invention of printing (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Press
Laws</a></span>) the crown, or other sovereign powers, granted patents
or licences with the object of restricting the right of
multiplying copies of literary works, and this supervision
<span class="sidenote">Historical account.</span>
of publication still has certain historical results.
A special kind of what amounts to perpetual copyright in various
publications has for various reasons been recognized by the laws
(1) in the crown, and (2) in the universities and colleges. The
various copyright acts, referred to below, except from their
provisions the copyrights vested in the two English and the four
Scottish universities, Trinity College, Dublin, and the colleges of
Eton, Westminster and Winchester. Crown copyrights are saved
by the general principle which exempts crown rights from the
operation of statutes unless they are expressly mentioned.
Among the books in which the crown has claimed copyright are
the English translation of the Bible, the Book of Common
Prayer, statutes, orders of privy council, proclamations, almanacs,
Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar, year books and law reports. The copyright
in the Bible is rested by some on the king&rsquo;s position as
head of the church; Lord Lyndhurst rested it on his duties as
the chief executive officer of the state charged with the publication
of authorized manuals of religion. The right of printing the
Bible and the Book of Common Prayer is vested in the king&rsquo;s
printer and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. These
copyrights do not extend to prohibit independent translations
from the original. The obsolete copyright of the crown in Lilly&rsquo;s
Latin Grammar was founded on the fact of its having been
drawn up at the king&rsquo;s expense. The universities have a joint
right (with the crown&rsquo;s patentees) of printing acts of <span class="correction" title="amended from parliment">parliament</span>.
Law reports were decided to be the property of the crown in the
reign of Charles II.; by act of parliament they were forbidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
to be published without licence from the chancellor and the
chiefs of the three courts, and this form of licence remained in use
after the act had expired. University and college copyrights
were made perpetual by an act of George III., but only on
condition of the books being printed at their printing presses
and for their own benefit.</p>

<p>3. The first definite statute, or Copyright Act, in England was
passed in 1709. The preamble states that printers, booksellers
and other persons were frequently in the habit of printing,
reprinting, and publishing &ldquo;books and other writings without
the consent of the authors or proprietors of such books and
writings, to their very great detriment, and too often to the
ruin of them and their families.&rdquo; &ldquo;For preventing, therefore, such
practices for the future, and for the encouragement of learned
men to compose and write useful books, it is enacted that the
author of any book or books already printed, who hath not
transferred to any other the copy or copies of such book or books
in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and
liberty of printing such book or books for the term of one-and-twenty
years, and that the author of any book or books already
composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter
be composed, and his assignee, or assignees, shall have the sole
liberty of printing and reprinting such book or books for the term
of fourteen years, to commence from the day of first publishing
the same, and no longer.&rdquo; The penalty for offences against the
act was declared to be the forfeiture of the illicit copies to the
true proprietor, and the fine of one penny per sheet, half to the
crown, and half to any person suing for the same. &ldquo;After the
expiration of the said term of fourteen years the sole right of
printing or disposing of copies shall return to the authors thereof,
if they are then living, or their representatives, for another term
of fourteen years.&rdquo; To secure the benefit of the act registration
at Stationers&rsquo; Hall was necessary. In section 4 was contained
the provision that if any person thought the price of a book
&ldquo;too high and unreasonable,&rdquo; he might complain to the archbishop
of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, the bishop of London,
the chiefs of the three courts at Westminster, and the vice-chancellors
of the two universities in England, and to the lord
president, lord justice general, lord chief baron of the exchequer,
and the rector of the college of Edinburgh in Scotland, who might
fix a reasonable price. Nine copies of each book were to be provided
for the royal library, the libraries of the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, the four Scottish universites, Sion
College, and the faculty of advocates at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It was believed for a long time that this statute had not
interfered with the rights of authors at common law. Ownership
of literary property at common law appears indeed to have been
recognized in some earlier statutes. The Licensing Act 1662
prohibited the printing of any work without the consent of the
<i>owner</i> on pain of forfeiture, &amp;c. This act expired in 1679, and
attempts to renew it were unsuccessful. The records of the
Stationers&rsquo; Company show that the purchase and sale of copyrights
had become an established usage, and the loss of the protection,
incidentally afforded by the Licensing Act, was felt as a
serious grievance, which ultimately led to the statute of 1709.
That statute, as the judges in <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> (1769, 4 Burr.
2303) pointed out, speaks of the ownership of literary property
as a known thing. Many cases are recorded in which the courts
protected copyrights not falling within the periods laid down
by the act. Thus in 1735 the master of the rolls restrained the
printing of an edition of the <i>Whole Duty of Man</i>, published in
1657. In 1739 an injunction was granted by Lord Hardwicke
against the publication of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, at the instance of persons
claiming under an assignment from Milton in 1667. In the case
of <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> the plaintiff, who had purchased the copyright
of Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Seasons</i> in 1729, claimed damages for an
unlicensed publication thereof by the defendant in 1763. The
jury found that before the statute it was usual to purchase from
authors the perpetual copyright of their works. Three judges,
among whom was Lord Mansfield, decided in favour of the
common law right; one was of the contrary opinion. The
majority thought that the act of 1709 was not intended to destroy
copyright at common law, but merely to protect it more efficiently
during the limited periods. <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>, however, was
speedily overruled by the case of <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i> in the
House of Lords in 1774. The judges were called upon to state
their opinions. A majority (seven to four) were of opinion that
the author and his assigns had at common law the sole right
of publication in perpetuity. A majority (six to five) were of
opinion that this right had been taken away by the statute of
1709, and a term of years substituted for the perpetuity. The
decision appears to have taken the trade by surprise. Many
booksellers had purchased copyrights not protected by the
statute, and they now petitioned parliament to be relieved
from the consequences of the decision in <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i>.
A bill for this purpose actually passed the House of Commons,
but Lord Camden&rsquo;s influence succeeded in defeating it in the
House of Lords. The result is that from that time on ordinary
copyright has been recognized except in so far as it is sanctioned
by statute. The university copyrights were, however, protected
in perpetuity by an act passed in 1775.</p>

<p>By an act of 1801 the penalty for infringement of copyright
was increased to threepence per sheet, in addition to the forfeiture
of the book. The proprietor was to have an action on the case
against any person in the United Kingdom, or British dominions
in Europe, who should print, reprint, or import without the
consent of the proprietor, first had in writing, signed in the
presence of two or more credible witnesses, any book or books, or
who knowing them to be printed, &amp;c., without the proprietor&rsquo;s
consent should sell, publish, or expose them for sale; the
proprietor to have his damages as assessed by the jury, and
double costs of suit. A second period of fourteen years was
confirmed to the author, should he still be alive at the end of the
first. Further, it was forbidden to import into the United
Kingdom for sale books first composed, written, or printed and
published within the United Kingdom, and reprinted elsewhere.
Another change was made by the act of 1814, which in substitution
for the two periods of fourteen years gave to the author and
his assignees copyright for the full term of twenty-eight years
from the date of the first publication, &ldquo;and also, if the author be
living at the end of that period, for the residue of his natural life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. The Copyright Act of 1842 repealed the previous acts on the
same subject, and is the basis of the existing law. Its preamble
stated its object to be to encourage the production of
&ldquo;literary matter of lasting benefit to the world.&rdquo; The
<span class="sidenote">Act of 1842.</span>
principal clause is the following (§ 3): &ldquo;That the copyright
in every book which shall after the passing of this act be
published in the lifetime of its author shall endure for the natural
life of such author, and for the further term of seven years,
commencing at the time of his death, and shall be the property of
such author and his assignees; provided always that if the said
term of seven years shall expire before the end of forty-two years
from the first publication of such book the copyright shall in that
case endure for such period of forty-two years; and that the
copyright of every book which shall be published after the death
of its author shall endure for the term of forty-two years from the
first publication thereof, and shall be the property of the proprietor
of the author&rsquo;s manuscript from which such book shall be
first published and his assigns.&rdquo; The benefit of the enlarged period
was extended to subsisting copyrights, unless they were the
property of an assignee who had acquired them by purchase, in
which case the period of copyright would be extended only if the
author or his personal representative agreed with the proprietor
to accept the benefit of the act. By section 5 the judicial
committee of the privy council may license the republication of
books which the proprietor of the copyright thereof refuses to
publish after the death of the author. The sixth section provides
for the delivery within certain times of copies of all books
published after the passing of the act, and of all subsequent
editions thereof, at the British Museum. And a copy of every
book and its subsequent editions must be sent <i>on demand</i> to the
following libraries: the Bodleian at Oxford, the public library at
Cambridge, the library of the faculty of advocates in Edinburgh,
and that of Trinity College, Dublin. Other libraries (the libraries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
of the four Scottish Universities, King&rsquo;s Inns, Dublin, and Sion
College) entitled to this privilege under the earlier acts had been
deprived thereof by an act passed in 1836, and grants from the
treasury, calculated on the annual average value of the books
they had received, were ordered to be paid to them as compensation.
A book of registry is ordered to be kept at Stationers&rsquo; Hall
for the registration of copyrights, to be open to inspection on
payment of one shilling for every entry which shall be searched
for or inspected. And the officer of Stationers&rsquo; Hall shall give a
certified copy of any entry when required, on payment of five
shillings; and such certified copies shall be received in evidence
in the courts as prima facie proof of proprietorship or assignment
of copyright or licence as therein expressed, and, in the case of
dramatic or musical pieces, of the right of representation or
performance. False entries shall be punished as misdemeanours.
The entry is to record the title of the book, the time of its publication,
and the name and place of abode of the publisher and
proprietor of copyright. Without making such entry no proprietor
can bring an action for infringement of his copyright, but
the entry is not otherwise to affect the copyright itself. Any
person deeming himself aggrieved by an entry in the registry may
complain to one of the superior courts, which will order it to be
expunged or varied if necessary. A proprietor may bring an
action on the case for infringement of his copyright, and the
defendant in such an action must give notice of the objections to
the plaintiff&rsquo;s title on which he means to rely. No person except
the proprietor of the copyright is allowed to import into the
British dominions for sale or hire any book first composed or
written or printed and published in the United Kingdom, and
reprinted elsewhere, under penalty of forfeiture and a fine of £10.
The proprietor of any encyclopaedia, review, magazine, periodical
work, or work published in a series of books or parts, who shall
have employed any person to compose the same, or any volumes,
parts, essays, articles, or portions thereof, for publication on the
terms that the copyright therein shall belong to such proprietor,
shall enjoy the term of copyright granted by the act.<a name="FnAnchor_1h" id="FnAnchor_1h" href="#Footnote_1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> But the
proprietor may not publish separately any article or review
without the author&rsquo;s consent, nor may the author unless he has
reserved the right of separate publication. Where neither party
has reserved the right they may publish by agreement, but the
author at the end of twenty-eight years may publish separately.
Proprietors of periodical works shall be entitled to all the benefits
of registration under the act, on entering in the registry the title,
the date of first publication of the first volume or part, and the
names of proprietor and publisher.</p>

<p>The interpretation clause of the act defines a book to be every
volume, part, or division of a volume, pamphlet, sheet of letter-press,
sheet of music, map, chart, or plan separately published.</p>

<p>5. During the last quarter of the 19th century the question of
copyright became continually more prominent, and a considerable
extension was given by judicial interpretation to the
scope of the act of 1842. &ldquo;Literary matter of lasting
<span class="sidenote">Recent extensions.</span>
benefit to the world&rdquo; came to include every publication
(not being illegal) which could be described as
&ldquo;literary&rdquo; or &ldquo;original,&rdquo; the criterion as to the latter qualification
being, in the last resort, whether (see <i>Trade Auxiliary Co.</i>
v. <i>Middlesborough Association</i>, 1889, 40 Ch.D. 425) the author
or compiler has really put his own brain-work into it.</p>

<p>6. The most marked and certain progress has been in the
application of the law of copyright to the periodical press, in
order to protect within reasonable limits the labour
and expenditure of newspapers that obtain for the
<span class="sidenote">Newspapers.</span>
public the earliest news and arrange it for publication.
It is settled law since 1881 (<i>Walter</i> v. <i>Howe</i>, 17 Ch.D. 708, overruling
<i>Cox</i> v. <i>Land &amp; Water Journal Co.</i>, 1869), that a newspaper
is a book within the meaning of the act, and can claim all rights
that a book has under the Copyright Act. Thus, leading articles,
special articles, and even news items are protected (<i>Walter</i> v.
<i>Steinkopff</i>, 1892, 3 Ch. 489; <i>Exchange Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Gregory
and Co.</i>, 1896, 1 Q.B. 147). Current prices of stocks and shares,
translations, the compilation of a directory, summaries of legal
proceedings, and other similar literary work, so far as the literary
form, the labour and money are concerned, are equally protected.
In short, the test may now be broadly stated to be, whether
labour of the brain and expenditure of money have been given
for the production; whilst the old requirement of original
matter is very broadly interpreted. The leading case on the
subject is <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i> (decided in the House of Lords, 6th
August 1900). The question there raised was, whether or not
copyright applied under the act of 1842 in respect of <i>verbatim</i>
reports of speeches. Four law lords, viz. Lord Chancellor
Halsbury, Lord Davey, Lord James of Hereford and Lord
Brampton upheld the claim to copyright in such cases, whilst
Lord Robertson was the sole dissentient.</p>

<p>Apart from newspapers, protection has been extended to
publications having no literary character; Messrs Maple&rsquo;s
furniture catalogue, and the Stock Exchange prices on the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;
have been awarded the same protection as directories. The
courts have declined to protect works which are mere copies
of railway time-tables, or the &ldquo;tips&rdquo; of a sporting prophet, or
mechanical devices with no independent literary matter, such
as patterns for cutting ladies&rsquo; sleeves.</p>

<p>7. The publication of lectures without consent of the authors
or their assignees is prohibited by the Lecture Copyright Act
1835, which reinforces the common law against publication
of &ldquo;unpublished&rdquo; matter, and gives a copyright
<span class="sidenote">Lectures.</span>
for 28 years. This act, however, excepts from its provisions:
(1) lectures of which notice has not been given two days before
their delivery to two justices of the peace living within 5 m.
to the place of delivery (an impracticable condition), and (2)
lectures delivered in universities and other public institutions.
Sermons by clergy of the established Church are believed to fall
within this exception. The leading cases are <i>Nicols</i> v. <i>Pitman</i>,
1884, 26 Ch.D. 374, and <i>Caird</i> v. <i>Sime</i>, 1887, 12 A.C. 326.</p>

<p>8. The writer of private letters sent to another person may
in general restrain their publication. It was urged in some of
the cases that the sender had abandoned his property
in the letter by the act of sending; but this was denied
<span class="sidenote">Private letters.</span>
by Lord Hardwicke (<i>Pope</i> v. <i>Curl</i> in 1741), who held
that at most the receiver only might take some kind of joint
property in the letter along with the author. Judge Story, in
the American case of <i>Folsom</i> v. <i>Marsh</i>, 2 Story (Amer.) 100,
states the law as follows: &ldquo;The author of any letter or letters,
and his representatives, whether they are literary letters or
letters of business, possess the sole and exclusive copyright
therein; and no person, neither those to whom they are addressed,
nor other persons, have any right or authority to publish the
same upon their own account or for their own benefit.&rdquo; But
there may be special occasions justifying such publication. See
also the English case of <i>Macmillan</i> v. <i>Dent</i> (1905).</p>

<p>9. The question of what is an infringement of copyright has
been the subject of much discussion. It was decided under the
statute of 1709 that a repetition from memory was
not a publication so as to be an infringement of
<span class="sidenote">Test of infringement.</span>
copyright. In the case of <i>Reade</i> v. <i>Conquest</i>, 1861,
9 C.B., the same view was taken. The defendant had
dramatized the plaintiff&rsquo;s novel <i>It&rsquo;s Never too Late to Mend</i>,
and the piece was performed at his theatre. This was held to
be no breach of copyright; but the circulation of copies of a
drama, so taken from a copyright novel, whether gratuitously or
for sale, is not allowed. Then again it is often a difficult question
to decide whether the alleged piratical copyright does more than
make that fair use of the original author&rsquo;s materials which the law
permits. It is not every act of borrowing literary matter from
another which is piracy, and the difficulty is to draw the line
between what is fair and what is unfair. Lord Eldon put the
question thus,&mdash;whether the second publication is a legitimate
use of the other in the fair exercise of a mental operation deserving
the character of an original work. Another test proposed is
&ldquo;whether you find on the part of the defendant an <i>animus
furandi</i>&mdash;an intention to take for the purpose of saving himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
labour.&rdquo; No one, it has been said, has a right to take, whether
with or without acknowledgment, a material and substantial
portion of another&rsquo;s work, his arguments, his illustrations, his
authorities, for the purpose of <span class="correction" title="amended from makinng">making</span> or improving a rival
publication. When the materials are open to all, an author may
acquire copyright in his selection or arrangement of them.
Several cases have arisen on this point between the publishers
of rival directories. Here it has been held that the subsequent
compiler is bound to do for himself what the original compiler had
done. When the materials are thus <i>in medio</i>, as the phrase is, it is
considered a fair test of piracy to examine whether the mistakes
of both works are the same. If they are, piracy will be inferred.
Translations stand to each other in the same relation as books
constructed of materials in common. The <i>animus furandi</i>,
mentioned above as a test of piracy, does not imply deliberate
intention to steal; it may be quite compatible with ignorance
even of the copyright work. Abridgments, moreover, of
original works appear to be favoured by the courts&mdash;when the
act of abridgment is itself an act of the understanding,
&ldquo;employed in carrying a large work into a smaller compass, and
rendering it less expensive.&rdquo; Lord Hatherley, however, in
<i>Tinsley</i> v. <i>Lacy</i>, 1863, 1 H. &amp; M. 747, incidentally expressed his
disapproval of this feeling&mdash;holding that the courts had gone
far enough in this direction, and that it was difficult to acquiesce
in the reason sometimes given that the compiler of an abridgment
is a benefactor to mankind by assisting in the diffusion of
knowledge. A mere selection or compilation, so as to bring
the materials into smaller space, will not be a bona fide abridgment;
&ldquo;there must be real substantial condensation, and
intellectual labour, and judgment bestowed thereon&rdquo; (Justice
Story). A publication professing to be <i>A Christmas Ghost Story,
Reoriginated from the Original by Charles Dickens, Esq., and
Analytically Condensed expressly for this Work</i>, was found
(<i>Dickens</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 1844, 8 Jur. 183) to be an invasion of Charles
Dickens&rsquo;s copyright in the original.</p>

<p>10. There can be no copyright in any but innocent publications.
Books of an immoral or irreligious tendency have been
repeatedly decided to be incapable of being made the
subject of copyright. In a case (<i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Injurious works.</span>
1 Jac. 471) before Lord Eldon in 1822, an injunction
had been obtained against a pirated publication of the plaintiff&rsquo;s
<i>Lectures on Physiology, Zoology, and the Natural History of Man</i>,
which the judge refused to continue, &ldquo;recollecting that the
immortality of the soul is one of the doctrines of the Scriptures,
and considering that the law does not give protection to those
who contradict the Scriptures.&rdquo; The same judge refused in
1822 to restrain a piracy of Lord Byron&rsquo;s <i>Cain</i>, and <i>Don Juan</i>
was refused protection in 1823. Compare also <i>Cowan</i> v. <i>Milbourn</i>,
1867, L.R. 2 Ex. 230, in which a contract to let a room for
lectures of an irreligious character was held not to be binding.</p>

<p>11. The quasi-copyright in titles of books, periodicals, &amp;c.
is founded on the desirability of preventing one person from
putting off on the public his own productions as those
of another. This is, however, not copyright, but a
<span class="sidenote">Titles of works.</span>
question of ordinary fraud. The name of a journal
(if sufficiently established) is a species of trade-mark in which
the law recognizes what it calls a &ldquo;species of property,&rdquo; provided
any misleading of the public is involved. Thus, the <i>Wonderful
Magazine</i> was invaded (1803) by a publication calling itself the
<i>Wonderful Magazine, New Series Improved</i>. <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life in
London</i> was pirated (1859) by a paper calling itself the <i>Penny
Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>. The proprietors of the <i>London Journal</i> got an
injunction (1859) against the <i>Daily London Journal</i>, which was
projected by the person from whom they had bought their own
paper, and who had covenanted with them not to publish any
<i>weekly</i> journal of a similar nature. A song published under the
title of <i>Minnie</i>, sung by Madame Anna Thillon and Miss Dolby
at Monsieur Jullien&rsquo;s concerts, was invaded (1855) by a song to
the same air published as <i>Minnie Dale, Sung at Jullien&rsquo;s Concerts
by Madame Anna Thillon</i>. On the other hand, the <i>Sphere</i> and
<i>Spear</i>, titles of misleading similarity, assumed by two weekly
periodicals that appeared almost simultaneously in London in
1900, could not successfully attack each other, because neither
had an established reputation when first adopted.</p>

<p>12. Dramatic and musical compositions stand on this peculiar
footing, that they may be the subject of two entirely distinct
rights. As writings they come within the general
Copyright Act, and the unauthorized multiplication of
<span class="sidenote">Drama and music.</span>
copies is a piracy of the usual sort. This was decided to
be so even in the case of musical compositions under
the act of 1709. The Copyright Act of 1842 includes a &ldquo;sheet
of music&rdquo; in its definition of a book. Separate from the copyright
thus existing in dramatic or musical compositions is the
stage-right or right of representing them on the stage; this was
the right created by the Dramatic Copyright Act of 1833, in the
case of dramatic pieces. This act gave the owner of the stage-right
(right of representation) a period of twenty-eight years, or
the duration of the author&rsquo;s life if longer. The Copyright Act
1842 extended this right to musical compositions, and made the
period in both cases the same as that fixed for copyright. And
the act expressly provides (meeting a contrary decision in the
courts) that the assignment of copyright of dramatic and musical
pieces shall not include the right of representation unless that
is expressly mentioned. The act of 1833 prohibited representation
&ldquo;at any place of public entertainment,&rdquo; a phrase which was
omitted in the act of 1842, and it may perhaps be inferred that
the restriction is now more general and would extend to any
unauthorized representation anywhere. A question has also
been raised whether, to obtain the benefit of the act, a musical
piece must be of a dramatic character. The dramatization of a
novel, <i>i.e.</i> the acting of a drama constructed out of materials
derived from a novel, is not necessarily an infringement of the
copyright in the novel (supposing it to be possible to do it without
making any sort of colourable copy of the literary form), but to
publish a drama so constructed has been held to be a breach of
copyright (<i>Tinsley</i> v. <i>Lacy</i>, 1863, 1 H. &amp; M. 747, where defendant
had published two plays founded on two of Miss Braddon&rsquo;s
novels, and reproducing the incidents and in many cases the
language of the original). Where two persons dramatize the same
novel, what, it may be asked, are their respective rights? In
<i>Toole</i> v. <i>Young</i>, 1874, 9 Q.B. 523, this point actually arose.
A, the author of a published novel, dramatized it and assigned
the drama to the plaintiff, but it was never printed, published
or represented upon the stage. B, ignorant of A&rsquo;s drama, also
dramatized the novel and assigned his drama to the defendant,
who represented it on the stage. It was held that any one might
dramatize A&rsquo;s published novel, and that the representation of
B&rsquo;s drama was not a representation of A&rsquo;s drama. This case may
be compared with <i>Reade</i> v. <i>Lacy</i> (1861).</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Little Lord Fauntleroy&rdquo; case (1888) the person who
dramatized the novel of another without his consent, an operation
up to that time believed to be unassailable in law, was attacked
successfully, by preventing him from using printed or written
copies of the play, either to deposit with the lord chamberlain
or as prompt-books. In every case where much of the original
dialogue of the novel is taken, this stops the production of the
dramatization.</p>

<p>In music, statutes of 1882 and 1888 have prevented the use
of the provisions inflicting penalties for the performance of copyright
songs for purposes of extortion, by allowing the court to
inflict a penalty of one farthing and make the plaintiff pay the
costs, if justice requires it. Authors reserving the right of public
performance are required to print a notice to that effect on all
copies of the music.</p>

<p>An important decision (which appears to be a grave injustice)
on musical copyright is the case of <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Whight</i> (1899;
followed in other cases&mdash;see <i>Mabe</i> v. <i>Conner</i>, 1909), in which it
was held that the reproduction of copyright tunes on the perforated
slips for an Aeolian or other mechanical instrument
is not an infringement of copyright. In Germany it has been
decided (<i>Lincke</i> v. <i>Gramophone Co.</i>) that the reproduction of
copyright music on a gramophone is an infringement, and an
injunction was granted. It has also been held in France that
the production of copyright <i>words</i> (but not music) was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
infringement, while in the United States the Copyright Act
of 1909 extended copyright control to mechanical reproductions,
and gave the copyright proprietor power to exact royalties.</p>

<p>The copyright in music was subject to serious injury in
England from the selling of pirated copies in the streets by
hawkers; and in 1902 an act was passed enabling summary
proceedings to be taken for having such copies seized and
destroyed. But this act had various practical defects, which
still left publishers largely at the mercy of the pirates. In 1905
the evil had become so serious that the chief music publishers
announced their intention of not producing any further works
till the law was altered; but the new Musical Copyright Bill of
that year was obstructed and talked out in the House of Commons.
In November 1905 an important prosecution, instituted by Messrs
Chappell on behalf of the associated music-publishers and
composers, was brought against a coterie of pirates. In the
session of 1906 another attempt, this time successful, was made
to pass a Musical Copyright Bill. This act (the Musical Copyright
Act 1906) made it a criminal offence, punishable with fine
and imprisonment, to reproduce or sell, or to possess plates for
the production of, pirated copies of musical works. The act also
gave power to a constable to arrest without warrant any person
who in any public place exposes for sale or has in his possession
for sale, or canvasses or personally advertises pirated copies,
provided that the apparent owner of the copyright signs an
authority requesting such arrest at his own risk. Also a court
of summary jurisdiction may grant a search warrant, if there
is reasonable ground for believing that an offence against the act
is being committed on any premises.</p>

<p>13. The right of foreigners under the English copyright acts
produced at one time an extraordinary conflict of judicial
opinion. A foreigner who during residence in the
British dominions should publish a work was admitted
<span class="sidenote">Rights of foreigners.</span>
to have a copyright therein. The question was whether
residence at the time of publication was necessary. In <i>Cocks</i> v.
<i>Purday</i>, the court of common pleas held that it was not. In
<i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Davidson</i>, the court of queen&rsquo;s bench, following the
decision of the court of common pleas in <i>Cocks</i> v. <i>Purday</i>, held
that a foreign author might have copyright in works first published
in England, although he was abroad at the time of publication.
But the court of exchequer, in <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Purday</i>, refused
to follow these decisions, holding that the legislature intended
only to protect its own subjects,&mdash;whether subjects by birth or by
residence. The question came before the House of Lords on
appeal in the case of <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Jeffreys</i> (1854), in which the
court of exchequer had taken the same line. The judges having
been consulted were found to be divided in opinion. Six of them
held that a foreigner resident abroad might acquire copyright
by publishing first in England. Four maintained the contrary.
The views of the minority were affirmed by the House of Lords
(Lord Chancellor Cranworth and Lords Brougham and St
Leonards). The lord chancellor&rsquo;s opinion was founded upon
&ldquo;the general doctrine that a British senate would legislate for
British subjects properly so called, or for such persons who
might obtain that character for a time by being resident in this
country, and therefore under allegiance to the crown, and under
the protection of the laws of England.&rdquo; Lord Brougham said
that</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The statute of Anne had been passed for the purpose of encouraging
learned men, and with that view that act had given them the
exclusive right in their publications for twenty-one years. This,
however, was clear, they had no copyright at common law, for if
they had there would have been no necessity for the passing of that
statute. It could scarcely be said that the legislature had decided
a century and a half since that act was to be passed to create a
monopoly in literary works solely for the benefit of foreigners. In
the present case he was clearly of opinion that the copyright did
not exist, and therefore that foreign law should not prevail over
British law where there was such diversity between the two.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Against the authority of this case, however, must be set the
opinion of two great lord chancellors&mdash;Lord Cairns and Lord
Westbury. In the case of <i>Routledge</i> v. <i>Low</i>, L.R. 3 H. L. 100,
1868, Lord Cairns said,</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The aim of the legislature is to increase the common stock of
the literature of the country; and if that stock can be increased by
the publication for the first time here of a new and valuable work
composed by an alien who has never been in the country, I see
nothing in the wording of the act which prevents, nothing in the
policy of the act which should prevent, and everything in the professed
object of the act and in its wide and general provisions which
should entitle such a person to the protection of the act, in return
and compensation for the addition he has made to the literature of
the country.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And Lord Westbury said, in the same case,</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The case of <i>Jeffreys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i> is a decision which is attached to
and depends on the particular statute of which it was the exponent,
and as that statute had been repealed and is now replaced by another
act, with different enactments expressed in different language,
the case of <i>Jeffreys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i> is not a binding authority in the
exposition of this later statute. The act appears to have been
dictated by a wise and liberal spirit, and in the same spirit it should
be interpreted, adhering of course to the settled rules of legal construction.
The preamble is, in my opinion, quite inconsistent with
the conclusion that the protection given by the statute was intended
to be confined to the works of British authors. The real condition
of obtaining its advantages is the first publication by the author of
his work in the United Kingdom. Nothing renders necessary his
bodily presence here at the time, and I find it impossible to discover
any reason why it should be required, or what it can add to the
merit of the first publication. If the intrinsic merits of the reasoning
on which, <i>Jeffreys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i> was decided be considered, I must
frankly admit that it by no means commands my assent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>These conclusions might follow also from the Naturalization
Act of 1870, which enacts that real and personal property of
every description may be taken, acquired, held, and disposed
of by an alien in the same manner in all respects as by a natural
born British subject. At the present time the International
Copyright Act has largely removed the question from the area
of conflict.</p>

<p>14. <i>International Copyright.</i>&mdash;Books published in one country
and circulated in another depend for their protection in the latter
upon international copyright. Until 1886 international
copyright in Great Britain rested on a series of orders
<span class="sidenote">The Bern Convention.</span>
in council, made under the authority of the International
Copyright Act 1844 (superseding acts of 1820
and 1826), conferring on the authors of a particular foreign
country the same rights in Great Britain as British authors, on
condition of their registering their work in Great Britain within a
year of first publication abroad. A condition of the granting of
each order was that the sovereign should be satisfied that
reciprocal protection was given in the country in question to
British authors. As the result of conferences at Bern in 1885 and
1887, this system was simplified and made more general by the
treaty known as &ldquo;The Bern Convention,&rdquo; signed at Bern on the
5th of September 1887. The contracting parties were the
British Empire, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland, Tunis and Hayti. Luxemburg, Monaco, Norway
and Japan afterwards joined. Austria and Hungary have a
separate convention with Great Britain, concluded on the 24th of
April 1893. The notable absentees among European powers are
Holland and Russia. So far as the United States is concerned, the
matter is regulated by the American copyright acts, which are
dealt with separately below.</p>

<p>The basis of the Bern convention was that authors of any of the
countries of the Union, or the publishers of works first published
in one of them, should enjoy in each of the other countries of the
Union the same rights as the law of that country granted to
native authors. The only conditions were that the work should
comply with the necessary formalities, such as registration, in
the country where it was first published, in which case it was
exempt from all such formalities elsewhere; and that the
protection required from any country should not exceed that
given in the country of origin. The rights conferred included the
sole right of making a translation of the work for ten years from
its first publication. The convention was retrospective; that is
to say, it applied to copyright works published before its coming
into existence, each country being allowed to protect vested
interests, or copies already made by others, as it should think
best.</p>

<p>The rights of foreign authors in Great Britain rest on legislation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
giving effect to the Bern convention, namely, the International
Copyright Act of 1886, and an order in council made under that
act, dated 28th November 1887. These confer on the author or
publisher of a work of literature or art first published in one of the
countries which are parties to the convention, after compliance
with the formalities necessary there, the same rights as if the work
had been first published in the United Kingdom, provided that
those rights are not greater than those enjoyed in the foreign
country.</p>

<p>The rights of British authors in foreign countries rest in each
country on the domestic legislation by which the particular
country has given effect to its promise contained in the Bern
convention, and are enforced by the courts of that country.
The Bern convention was revised in minor details not affecting its
broad principles by a conference meeting in 1896 in Paris, and
Great Britain adopted the results of their labours by an order in
council dated 7th March 1898. A further simplification in the
international law of copyright was expected to result from the
efforts of the international conference at Berlin in 1908, July 1910
being the latest date at which ratification by the states concerned
might take place, but it cannot here be stated to what extent
legislation may give effect to the decisions arrived at. So far as
these decisions affect Great Britain, the greatest alterations of
existing law would be in establishing throughout the Union
protection of musical copyright, especially with regard to singing
and talking machines, and also in the matter of newspaper
copyright. The conference adopted a threefold division of
newspaper matter: (1) serial stories, tales and all other work,
literary, scientific and artistic, which is to have absolute
protection; (2) all newspaper matter, except the foregoing and
mere items of general news (<i>faits divers</i>), of which reproduction
is to be permitted on acknowledgment of the source, unless such
reproduction is expressly forbidden; (3) news of the day and
simple facts, to which no protection is given. An endeavour was
also made to have a uniform period throughout the Union for
copyright of the author&rsquo;s life and 50 years.</p>

<p>15. <i>Colonial Copyright.</i>&mdash;Under English copyright, books of
the United Kingdom were formerly protected in the colonies by
the Colonial Copyright Act of 1847, and copies of them printed or
reprinted elsewhere could not be imported into the colonies. In
1876 a royal commission was appointed to consider the whole
question of home, colonial and international copyright; and
various recommendations were made. But the matter now rests
on the English International Copyright Act 1886, which contains
provisions designed to extend the benefit of the British
copyright acts to works first produced in the colonies, while
allowing each colony to legislate separately for works first
produced within its own limits. The colonies at present are all
included in the system of international copyright established by
the Bern convention.</p>

<p>In 1875 an act was passed (re-enacted in 1886 in the revised
Canadian statutes) to give effect to an act of the parliament of the
Dominion of Canada respecting copyright. An order in council
in 1868 had suspended the prohibition against the importation of
foreign reprints of English books into Canada, and the parliament
had passed a bill on the subject of copyright as to which doubts
had arisen whether it was not repugnant to the Order in Council.
It was also enacted that, after the bill came into operation, if an
English copyright book became entitled to Canadian copyright,
no Canadian reprints thereof should be imported into the United
Kingdom, unless by the owner of the copyright. The following
points in the Canadian act are worth noting:&mdash;Any person printing
or publishing an unprinted manuscript without the consent
of the author or legal proprietor shall be liable in damages (§ 3).
Any person domiciled in Canada, or in any part of the British
possessions, or being a citizen of any country having an international
copyright treaty with the United Kingdom, who is the
author of any book, map, &amp;c., &amp;c., shall have the sole right and
liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, &amp;c., for the term of
twenty-eight years. The work must be printed and published, or
reprinted or republished in Canada, whether before or after its
publication elsewhere: and the Canadian privilege is not to be continued
after the copyright has ceased elsewhere. And &ldquo;no immoral
or licentious, or irreligious, or treasonable, or seditious literary,
scientific or artistic work&rdquo; shall be the subject of copyright (§ 4).
A further period of fourteen years will be continued to the author
or his widow and children. An &ldquo;interim copyright&rdquo; pending
publication may be obtained by depositing in the office of the
minister of agriculture (who keeps the register of copyrights) a
copy of the title of the work; and works printed first in a series of
articles in a periodical, but intended to be published as books, may
have the benefit of this interim copyright. If a copyright work
becomes out of print, the owner may be notified of the act through
the minister of agriculture, who, if he does not apply a remedy,
may license a new edition, subject to a royalty to the owner.
Anonymous books may be entered in the name of the first
publisher. In 1889 an amending Canadian act was passed, which
led to a long controversy with the Mother Country,&mdash;the imperial
government refusing to sanction it,&mdash;till in 1900 a compromise
was effected, and a further act amending that of 1886 became
law. It applies only to books copyright in Canada, and, subject
to certain reservations, allows the minister of agriculture to
prohibit the importation, without consent of the licensees, of any
copies printed elsewhere of books published in the British
dominions licensed by the owners to be reproduced in Canada.</p>

<p>The Australian states all have copyright laws modelled on
the English. New Zealand provides for a term of 28 years, or
the author&rsquo;s life. In Cape Colony the term for books is the
author&rsquo;s life and 5 years, or a minimum of 30 years. The Indian
act of 1847 is modelled on the English.</p>

<p>16. <i>Other Countries.</i>&mdash;The following notes give the general
terms of the copyright law in other countries of importance.
<span class="sidenote">Foreign law.</span>
For details reference must be made to text-books.
We only deal specifically with the history and particulars
of American copyright.</p>

<p><i>Austria</i>, by a law of 1895, gives copyright for thirty years
after author&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i>&mdash;Copyright formerly perpetual, now limited to the
life of the author, and 50 years thereafter.</p>

<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;Copyright in France is recognized in the most
ample manner. Two distinct rights are secured by law&mdash;1st,
the right of reproduction of literary works, musical compositions,
and works of art; and 2nd, the right of representation
of dramatic works and musical compositions. The period
is for the life of the author and fifty years after his death.
After the author&rsquo;s death the surviving consort has the usufructuary
enjoyment of the rights which the author has not
disposed of in his lifetime or by will, subject to reduction for the
benefit of the author&rsquo;s protected heirs if any. The author may
dispose of his rights in the most absolute manner in the forms
and within the limits of the Code Napoléon. Piracy is a crime
punishable by fine of not less than 100 nor more than 2000 francs;
in the case of a seller from 25 to 500 francs. The pirated edition
will be confiscated. Piracy also forms the ground for a civil
action of damages to the amount of the injury sustained&mdash;the
produce of the confiscation, if any, to go towards payment of
the indemnity (Penal Code, Art. 425-429).</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i>&mdash;Period fixed in 1837 at ten years; but copyright
for longer periods was granted for voluminous and costly works,
and for the works of German poets. Among others the works
of Schiller, Goethe, Wieland, &amp;c., were protected for a period of
twenty years from the date of the decree in each case. In 1845
the period was extended in all cases to the author&rsquo;s life and
thirty years after. The present law rests on a Codifying Act of
1901, the term being the author&rsquo;s life and 30 years, or not less
than 10 years in any case.</p>

<p><i>Greece.</i>&mdash;Copyright is for fifteen years from publication.</p>

<p><i>Holland.</i>&mdash;Fifty years, or author&rsquo;s life, whichever is longer.</p>

<p><i>Hungary.</i>&mdash;by a law of 1884, gives a copyright for the author&rsquo;s
life and 50 years after.</p>

<p><i>Italy.</i>&mdash;Life of author, or 40 years from date of publication;
and afterwards a further period of 40 years, subject to a right
in others to reproduce on payment of 5% on each copy.</p>

<p><i>Japan.</i>&mdash;Author&rsquo;s life and 30 years after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
<i>Norway</i>, by a law of 1893, gives protection for author&rsquo;s life
and 50 years after.</p>

<p><i>Portugal.</i>&mdash;Author&rsquo;s life and 50 years after.</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i>&mdash;Author&rsquo;s life and 50 years.</p>

<p><i>Spain.</i>&mdash;Author&rsquo;s life and 80 years thereafter.</p>

<p><i>Sweden and Denmark</i> provide for a term of the author&rsquo;s
lifetime and 50 years after.</p>

<p><i>Switzerland.</i>&mdash;Author&rsquo;s life and 30 years after.</p>

<p><i>Turkey.</i>&mdash;Author&rsquo;s life, or 40 years, whichever is the longer.</p>

<p>17. <i>United States.</i>&mdash;American copyright is provided for by
an act of March 1909, which replaced acts of July 1870 and
March 1891, both of which had introduced important
modifications in the original act of 1790. Under all
<span class="sidenote">American law.</span>
acts preceding that of 1891, copyright had been granted
to &ldquo;citizens or residents of the United States,&rdquo; the term
&ldquo;resident&rdquo; having been, in decisions prior to 1891, construed
to mean a person domiciled in the United States with the
intention of making there his permanent abode. The works
of foreigners could thus be reproduced without authorization,
and they were so reproduced in so far as there was prospect of
financial gain. The leading publishers, however, had from the
earliest times made terms with British authors, or with their
representatives, the British publishers, for producing authorized
American editions. But at most they were only able to secure
by this means an advantage of a few weeks&rsquo; priority over the
unauthorized editions, and the good-will of the conscientious
buyer; so that if they paid the author any considerable sum,
the price of the authorized editions had to be made so high that
it was not easy to secure a remunerative sale. The unauthorized
editions had the further advantage in competition, that for the
purpose of being manufactured more promptly and more
economically, they could be and often were issued in an abbreviated
and garbled form, an injury which to not a few writers
seemed more grievous than the lack of pecuniary profit. In
Great Britain, during the first half of the 19th century, the copyright
law had been so interpreted as to secure recognition of the
rights of American authors for such works as were produced
there not later than in any other country, so that authors like
Washington Irving and Fenimore Cooper secured for a time
satisfactory returns; but after 1850 the conditions became the
same as in the United States. Unauthorized editions were
published, and were often incomplete and garbled.</p>

<p>As from decade to decade the books produced on either side
of the Atlantic, which possessed interest for readers of the other
side, increased in quantity and in importance, the evil of these
unrestricted piracies increased. The injury to British authors
was greater only in proportion as the English books were more
numerous. The pressure from Great Britain during the last
half of the 19th century for international copyright was continuous;
and in America it was recognized by authors, by
representative publishers, and by the more intelligent people
everywhere, that the existing conditions were of material
disadvantage. The loss to American authors was direct; and
the loss to legitimate American publishers was also clear, in that
better returns could be secured by adequate payments for
rights that could be protected by law than by &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo;
payments for authorizations that carried no legal rights. An
injury was being done to American literature; for, when
authorized editions of American works had to compete against
unauthorized and more cheaply produced editions of English
works, the business incentive for literary production was seriously
lessened. In fiction particularly, authors had to contend against
a flood of cheaply produced editions of &ldquo;appropriated&rdquo; English
books. Equally to be condemned were the ethics of a relation
under which one class of property could be appropriated while
other classes secured legal protection. On these several grounds
efforts had long been made to secure international copyright.
Between 1843 and 1886 no less than eleven international copyright
bills were drafted, for the most part at the instance of the
copyright associations or copyright leagues. They were one
after the other killed in committee. In 1886 the twelfth international
copyright bill was brought before the Senate by Senator
Jonathan Chace of Rhode Island, and was referred to the
committee on patents. In 1887 the American Publishers&rsquo;
Copyright League (succeeding the earlier American Publishers&rsquo;
Association) was organized, with William H. Appleton as
president and G. H. Putnam as secretary. The executive
committee of this league formed, with a similar committee of
the Author&rsquo;s Copyright League, a conference committee, under
the direction of which the campaign for copyright was continued
until the passage of the act of March 1891. Of the Authors&rsquo;
Copyright League James Russell Lowell was the first president,
being succeeded by Edmund Clarence Stedman. The secretary
during the active work of the league was Robert U. Johnson.
Under the initiative of the conference committee copyright
leagues were organized in Boston, Chicago, St Louis, Cincinnati,
Minneapolis, Denver, Colorado City and other places. The
Chace Bill was introduced in the House in March 1888. In
May 1890 this bill, with certain modifications, came before the
House, and was there defeated. In March 1891 the same
measure, with certain further modifications, secured a favourable
vote in the House during the last hour of the last day of the
session, was passed by the Senate, and was promptly signed
by President Harrison. Thus, after a struggle extending over
fifty-three years, the United States accepted the principle at
all events of international copyright.</p>

<p>18. The act of 1891 was criticized in several respects: (1)
A condition was that books or works of art must be &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo;
in America; consideration not being given to books
originally produced in some language other than English. (2)
It required publication in the United States simultaneously with
that in the country of origin. (3) The term of copyright (28
years, with an extension of 14 years to the author if alive, or to
widow or children) was shorter than that accorded under the law
of any other literature-producing country, excepting Greece.
Minor amending acts were passed in 1893, 1895 and 1897, that
of Feb. 19, 1897, establishing as the copyright department of
the library of Congress a Bureau of Copyrights, the head of which
bears the title of Register of Copyrights. Eventually, after hard
<span class="sidenote">Provisions of Act of 1909.</span>
work by the American Authors&rsquo; Copyright League
and the Publishers&rsquo; Copyright League, and after
sittings extending to a period of three years, a new bill
submitted to Congress by the two Committees on
Patents of the House of Representatives and the Senate was
successfully passed. It came into force on the 1st of July 1909.
Its provisions may be briefly summarized as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Copyright is granted to authors for twenty-eight years from the
date of first publication, whether the copyrighted work bears the
author&rsquo;s true name or is published anonymously or under
an assumed name. A further term of twenty-eight years
<span class="sidenote">Term of copyright.</span>
is granted to the author if at the expiration of the first
term he be still living, or to his widow and children if he be dead.
If the author&rsquo;s widow and children be dead an extension is granted
to the author&rsquo;s executors, or in the absence of a will, to his next of
kin. Applications for renewal and extension must be made to the
copyright office and duly registered therein within one year prior
to the expiration of the existing term. To any work in which
copyright subsists at the time the act went into force the act extends
renewal for a period of twenty-eight years at the expiration of the
time provided for under the previously existing law (first period
28 years, renewal period 14 years). The works for which copyright
may be secured under the act &ldquo;Shall include all the writings of an
author.&rdquo; For purposes of registration the act classifies (1) books,
<span class="sidenote">Definition of copyright.</span>
including composite and cyclopaedic works, directories,
gazetteers and other compilations; (2) periodicals, including
newspapers; (3) lectures, sermons, addresses, prepared
for oral delivery; (4) dramatic or dramatico-musical
compositions; (5) musical compositions; (6) maps; (7)
works of art; models or designs for works of art; (8) reproductions
of a work of art; (9) drawings or plastic works of a scientific or
technical character; (10) photographs and (11) prints and pictorial
illustrations. But compilations or abridgments, adaptations,
arrangements, dramatizations, translations or other versions of
copyrighted works, when produced with the consent of the proprietors
of the copyrighted work are, under the 1909 act, new works subject
to copyright. A citizen or subject of a foreign state can secure
copyright only when he is domiciled within the United States at the
time of the first publication of his work, or when the foreign state
or nation of which he is a subject grants, either by treaty, convention,
agreement or law, to citizens of the United States the benefit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
copyright on substantially the same basis as to its own citizens, or
copyright protection equal to that secured by the foreign author
under the United States act, or when the foreign state is a party to
an international agreement providing for reciprocity in the granting
of copyright, and the United States may, by the terms of that
agreement, become a party thereto. After copyright has been
secured by publication of a work, two complete copies of the best
edition published must be &ldquo;promptly&rdquo; deposited in the copyright
office, or mailed to the register of copyrights, the postmaster, on
request, giving a receipt and mailing the books without cost. If the
work be a contribution to a periodical, one copy of the issue containing
it must be sent, or if it be a work not reproduced in copies for
sale, a copy, print, photograph or other identifying reproduction
must accompany the claim. Prior to 1891 the works of authors
could be put into print on either side of the Atlantic. The act of
1891 laid down that, in order to secure copyright, all editions of the
works of all authors, resident or non-resident, must be entirely
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Manufacture&rdquo; clause.</span>
manufactured within the United States, the term &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo;
including the setting of type as well as printing
and binding. This manufacturing condition was insisted
on by the typographical unions. There is no logical
connexion, however, between the right of an author or artist to the
control of his production and the interests of American workmen;
the attempt to legislate for them jointly must bring about no little
confusion and inequity. If American working-men cannot secure a
living in competition with labourers on the other side of the Atlantic,
their needs should be cared for under the provisions of the protective
tariff. It is, however, the belief of a large number of those who are
engaged in the manufacturing of books that, with his advanced
methods of work, the skilled American labourer has no reason to
dread the competition of European craftsmen. With this manufacturing
condition out of the way, there would be nothing to
prevent the United States from becoming a party to the Bern
Convention. This would place intellectual property on both sides
of the Atlantic on the same footing. The power of the unions was
sufficiently strong to prevent this condition being eliminated from
the act of 1909, but the just claims were met of authors whose books
are originally produced in some language other than English, the
<span class="sidenote">Exemption of text of foreign book.</span>
&ldquo;original text of a book of foreign origin in a language or
languages other than English&rdquo; being exempted from the
requirements as to type-setting in the United States. On
the other hand the manufacturing condition is extended by
the act of 1909 to illustrations within a book, and also to
separate lithographs or photo-engravings, &ldquo;except where in either
case the subjects represented are located in a foreign country and
illustrate a scientific work or reproduce a work of art.&rdquo; The notice
of copyrights required by the act consists either of the word &ldquo;copyright&rdquo;
or by the abbreviation &ldquo;Copr.,&rdquo; accompanied by the name
of the copyright proprietor, and in the case of printed literary,
musical or dramatic works, the notice must include also the year in
which the copyright was secured by publication. In the case of
works specified in 6 to 11 inclusive, of the classification given above,
the copyright notice may consist of the letter C enclosed within a
circle, thus: ©, accompanied by the initials, monogram, mark or
symbol of the copyright proprietor, provided that on some accessible
portion of the copy or of the margin, or on the back or pedestal his
name appears.</p>

<p>The act of 1909 gives an <i>interim</i> protection to a book published
abroad in the English language before publication in the United
States, the deposit in the copyright office, not later than
<span class="sidenote">Interim protection.</span>
thirty days after its publication abroad, of one complete
copy of the foreign edition, with a request for the reservation
of the copyright and a statement of the name and
nationality of the author and copyright proprietor, securing copyright
for thirty days from the date of deposit. Any person infringing
<span class="sidenote">Infringement.</span>
a copyright work is liable to an injunction, and to pay such
damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered
by the infringement; in lieu of actual damages and profits
the courts may award such damages as appear to be just, and in
assessing them may, at its discretion, allow the amounts mentioned
below, except that in the case of a newspaper reproduction of a
copyrighted photograph such damages must not exceed the sum of
two hundred and fifty dollars nor be less than fifty dollars, and in
no other case must the damages be more than five thousand dollars
or less than two hundred and fifty dollars: (1) In the case of a
painting, statue or sculpture, ten dollars for any infringing copy
made or sold or found in the possession of the infringer or his agents
or employees; (2) in the case of any work enumerated in the classification
given before, except a painting, statue or sculpture, one dollar
for every infringing copy; (3) in the case of a lecture, sermon or
address, fifty dollars for every infringing delivery; (4) in the case of
dramatic or dramatico-musical or a choral or orchestral composition,
one hundred dollars for the first and fifty dollars for every subsequent
infringing performance; in the case of other musical compositions,
<span class="sidenote">Musical compositions.</span>
ten dollars for every infringing performance; all infringing
copies and devices must also be delivered up for destruction.
The act gives full control over his compositions
to a musical composer, and the right to make any
arrangement or setting of it, or of the melody of it, in any system of
notation or form of record from which it may be read or reproduced.
His right to control the reproduction of his music by mechanical
instruments is restricted (1) to cover only music published and
copyrighted after the act went into effect; (2) to include a musical
composition by a foreign composer only in the case of a citizen of a
foreign state that grants to citizens of the United States similar
rights; (3) where the owner of a musical copyright has permitted
the use of his work upon parts of instruments serving to reproduce
the composition mechanically, permission for a similar use of such
work must be accorded to any other person on the payment of a
fixed royalty of two cents on each part manufactured. The act makes
<span class="sidenote">Transfer and assignment of copyright.</span>
a clear distinction between the property in the copyright
and that in the material object representing the copyright,
and enacts that the sale or conveyance of the material
object shall not of itself constitute a transfer of the copyright.
Transfer of copyright in the United States is to be
effected by an instrument in writing signed by the proprietor
of the copyright, or the copyright may be bequeathed by
will. Assignment of copyright executed in a foreign country must
be acknowledged by the assignor before a consular officer of the
United States. Every assignment of copyright must be recorded
in the copyright office within three calendar months after its execution
in the United States or within six months without the limits of
the United States. The importation into the United States is forbidden
of any piratical copies of a copyrighted book or of any copies
<span class="sidenote">Importation of copyright works.</span>
not produced in accordance with the manufacturing
provisions of the act (although authorized by the author
or proprietor), but importation is allowed to any society
or institution incorporated for educational, literary,
philosophical, scientific or religious purposes, or for the
encouragement of the fine arts, or to any State school, college, &amp;c.,
or to free public libraries, when importation is for use and not for
sale. The act of 1891 allowed &ldquo;<i>two</i> copies in any one invoice&rdquo; to be
imported, but by the act of 1909 not more than <i>one</i> copy is to be
imported in one invoice.</p>
</div>

<p>The provisions having to do with international copyright
become operative in the case of a foreign state only when the
president proclaims that the state has fulfilled the condition of
reciprocity. The act of 1891 was put into force with foreign
states as follows:&mdash;1st of July 1891, Great Britain, Belgium,
France, Switzerland; 8th of March 1892, Germany (by separate
treaty); 31st of October 1892, Italy; 8th of May 1893, Denmark;
15th of July 1895, Spain; 20th of July 1895, Portugal; 27th of
February 1896, Mexico; 13th of April 1896, Sweden and Norway;
25th of May 1896, Chile; 19th of October 1899, Costa Rica; 20th
of November 1899, the kingdom of the Netherlands. In the case
of each state the territory covered by the provisions of the law
included the possessions, dependencies, &amp;c. The copyright agreement
with Great Britain therefore covered the crown colonies
of the empire, including India and the self-governing dominions
and states, such as Canada, Australia, &amp;c. An American work
duly entered for copyright in Great Britain secures, as a British
publication secures, the protection of copyright under the
provisions of the Bern convention throughout the territory of
the several states that are parties to that convention.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">Artistic Copyright</p>

<p>19. Literary authors had protection for their literary work
much earlier than artists for their artistic productions. Pictures
and illustrations, when included in books or newspapers, are
protected by the law which applies to the latter, but that is a
separate question. It was not until the reign of George II. that
the legislature in England afforded any protection for the work
of artists. The English law on artistic copyright is alone considered
in this account, the American having been included in the
section <i>United States</i> above (18), while for other countries the
details are so various that it is only possible to refer the reader
to the leading text-books.</p>

<p>The first Artists&rsquo; Copyright Bill was passed in the interest
of William Hogarth, one of the greatest of English painters,
who was engraver as well as painter, and who devoted
a considerable portion of his time to engraving his
<span class="sidenote">Engravings.</span>
own works. No sooner, however, were these published
than his market was seriously damaged by the issue of inferior
copies of his engravings by other publishers. To protect Hogarth
from such piracy the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 was passed,
which provided that &ldquo;every person who should invent and
design, engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaroscuro, any
historical or other print or prints, should have the sole right and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
liberty of printing and representing the same for the term of
fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing
thereof, which shall be truly engraved with the name of the proprietor
on each plate, and printed on every such print or prints.&rdquo;
The penalty for piracy was the forfeiture of the plate and all
prints, with a fine of 5s. for every pirated print.</p>

<p>In 1766, in the reign of George III., a second Engraving
Copyright Act was passed &ldquo;to amend and render more effectual&rdquo;
the first act, and &ldquo;for vesting and securing to Jane Hogarth,
widow, the property in certain prints,&rdquo; which extended the
protection beyond the designer, who was also engraver, to any
person who, not being himself a designer, made, or caused to
be made, an engraving from any picture or other work of art.
Jane Hogarth, the widow of the painter, found herself nearing
the termination of the fourteen years&rsquo; term of copyright grant
by the first act, with the probability that immediately on its
expiry the engravings of her husband then on sale, and on which
her livelihood depended, would be immediately pirated. It
was mainly to save her from the loss of her livelihood that this
second Copyright Bill extended the term of the copyright to
twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>The engravers and publishers of the day were not over-scrupulous,
and they sought to evade the penalties of the copyright
acts by taking the designs, and adding to them or taking
from them, or both, and producing fresh engravings, seeking to
make it appear that they were producing new works. These practices
assumed such proportions that it became necessary, in 1777,
to call upon parliament to put through another short measure
still further to protect the engraver, by prohibiting the copying
&ldquo;in whole or in part&rdquo; (a clause not contained in the previous
acts), by varying, adding to, or diminishing from, the main design
of an engraving without the express consent of the proprietor or
proprietors. These three acts remain in force to the present day.
In 1852, in an international copyright act, it was declared that the
Engraving Copyright Acts collectively were intended to include
prints taken by lithography or any other mechanical process.</p>

<p>20. In May 1814 the Sculpture Copyright Act was passed to
give protection to sculptors. The term of copyright for sculptors
was a peculiar one. It was to last for fourteen years,
with the proviso that, should the author be still alive,
<span class="sidenote">Sculpture.</span>
he should enjoy a further period of fourteen years, the copyright
returning to him for the second fourteen should he have disposed
of it for the first period. It is a condition of copyright with
the sculptor that the author must put his name with the date
upon every work before putting it forth or publishing it. A
curious and interesting point in the interpretation of this act is,
that according to the opinion of eminent jurists it is necessary to
an infringement of the copyright of a piece of sculpture that the
copy of it must take the form of another piece of sculpture;
that a photograph, drawing, or engraving of a piece of sculpture
is not to be considered a reproduction of it, and is therefore
not an infringement of the sculptor&rsquo;s copyright.</p>

<p>21. Strange as it may seem, painting was the last branch of
the arts to receive copyright protection. The cause of the
painters was taken up by the Society of Arts, who
endeavoured, in the first instance, to pass an amendment
<span class="sidenote">Painting.</span>
and consolidation bill dealing with engraving, sculpture and
painting; but, failing in their first effort, they limited their
second to an attempt to pass a bill in favour of painting, drawing
and photography. It was in the year 1862 that this act, having
passed through parliament, came into force. The absence of
any antecedent protection for the painter is clearly stated in
its preamble, which reads as follows: &ldquo;Whereas by law as now
established, the authors of paintings, drawings, and photographs
have no copyright in such their works, and it is expectant that
the law should in that respect be amended. Be it, therefore,
enacted,&rdquo; &amp;c. This preamble makes it clear that there is no
copyright in any paintings, drawings, or photographs executed
and dealt with before the year 1862&mdash;to be exact, 29th July of
that year. The duration of the term of copyright in this act of
1862 differs from its predecessors, by being made dependent on
the life of the author, to which life seven years were added. In
the Literary Copyright Act there are two terms&mdash;the life of the
author and seven years, or forty-two years, whichever may
prove the longer. In taking a fixed term like forty-two years
it is necessary to have something to start from, and with a
literary work it was easy to start from the date of publication.
But pictures are not published. They may pass from the studio
to the wall of the purchaser without being made public in any
way. The difficulty was evidently before the author of this act,
and the artist&rsquo;s term was made his life and seven years after his
death without any alternative. This term applies equally to
photographers. Perhaps no bill which ever passed through
parliament ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting a certain set
of people has failed so completely as has this bill to accomplish
its end. It started by proposing to give copyright to authors
of paintings, drawings and photographs, and it would seem that
no difficulty ought to have arisen as to whom such copyright
should rightly belong; but the following clause of the act has
introduced confusion into the question of ownership:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Provided that when any painting, or drawing, or the negative
of any photograph, shall for the first time after the passing of
this act be sold or disposed of, or shall be made or executed for
or on behalf of any other person for a good or valuable consideration,
the person so selling or disposing of, or making or executing
the same, shall not retain the copyright thereof unless it be expressly
reserved to him by agreement in writing, signed at or before the
time of such sale or disposition, by the vendee or assignee of such
painting or drawing, or such negative of a photograph, or by the
person on whose behalf the same shall be so made or executed;
but the copyright shall belong to the vendee or assignee of such
painting or drawing, or such negative of a photograph, or to the
person for or on whose behalf the same shall have been made or
executed; nor shall the vendee or assignee thereof be entitled to such
copyright unless at or before the time of such sale or disposition an
agreement in writing, signed by the person so selling or disposing of
the same, or by his agent duly authorized, shall have been made to
that effect.</p>
</div>

<p>That is to say, after promising the author copyright in his work
for life and seven years, the act stipulates that in order to get it
the author must, at the time of the first sale or disposition of his
picture, obtain a document in writing from the purchaser of the
picture, reserving the copyright to the author, and the act goes
on to say that if he does not take this step the copyright becomes
the property of the purchaser of the picture, but with the
proviso, in order to secure it to him, he must have a document
signed by the artist assigning the copyright to him; but if neither
of these things is done, and no document is signed, the copyright
does not belong to either the artist who sells or the client who
buys, and the act is silent as to whom it does belong to. It has
disappeared and belongs to no one. There is no copyright existing
in the work for any one. It has passed into the public domain,
and any one who can get access to the work may reproduce it.
Now, as most purchases are made from the walls of exhibitions,
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the copyright is absolutely
lost. And where the sale is arranged directly between the artist
and his client, the difficulty experienced by the artist in raising
the question as to whom the copyright shall belong to is so great,
owing to the dread lest the mere mention of the signing of a
document should cause the selling of the picture to fall through,
that in numerous such cases the copyright lapses and becomes
public property. Photographers are not affected by this clause,
because they do not as a rule sell the negatives they produce, and
with them the copyright lies in the negative. They carry on their
trade in prints without the question of the negative arising.
The picture-dealer, also, who buys a picture and copyright is
not subjected to the same disability as the painter. The picture-dealer
can sell a picture without saying a word to his client as
to the copyright, which he, nevertheless, retains intact; the
provision is applicable only to the <i>first</i> sale of the work, which,
therefore, throws the whole of the disability upon the painter.</p>

<p>The act gives the copyright of every work executed on commission
to the person by whom it is commissioned. It makes
it compulsory upon every owner of a copyright that he should
register it at Stationers&rsquo; Hall before he can take any action at
law to protect it. The copyright does not lapse if unregistered,
but so long as it remains unregistered no action at law can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
taken on account of any infringement. A copyright can be
registered at any time, even after an infringement, but the owner
of the copyright cannot recover for any infringement before
registration. The act provides for both penalties and damages
in the following cases:&mdash;(1) For infringing copyright in the
ordinary way by issuing unlawful copies. (2) For fraudulently
signing or affixing a fraudulent signature to a work of art. (3)
For fraudulently dealing with a work so signed. (4) For fraudulently
putting forth a copy of a work of art, whether there be
copyright in it or no, as the original work of the artist. (5) For
altering, adding to, or taking away from a work during the
lifetime of the author if it is signed, and putting it forth as the
unaltered work of the author. (6) For importing pirated works.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The incongruities of this act were so apparent that its promoters
desired to stop it, feeling that it would be better to have no bill at all
than one which conferred so little upon the people it was intended to
benefit; but Lord Westbury, the lord chancellor, who had charge of
the bill in the House of Lords, advised them to let it go through with
all its imperfections, that they might get the right of the painter to
protection recognized. This advice was followed, and the bill had no
sooner become law than a fresh effort was started to have it amended.
Year by year the agitation went on, with the exception only of a
period when Irish affairs took up all the attention of parliament, and
domestic legislation was rendered impossible. But in 1898 the
Copyright Association of Great Britain promoted a bill, which
was introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Herschell. It
was a measure designed to deal with all forms of copyright&mdash;literary,
musical, dramatic and artistic&mdash;and was remitted by the House of
Lords for consideration to a committee, which, having sat for three
sessions, decided not to proceed with Lord Herschell&rsquo;s measure,
but to treat literature and art in separate bills. It had under its
consideration an artistic bill, drafted for and presented by the Royal
Academy, and a literary bill and an artistic bill drafted by the
committee itself. The main proposals in the latter were to give
copyright to the author of any artistic work or photograph for a
period of life and thirty years, unless the work be commissioned,
in which case the copyright was to be the property of the employer,
except in the case of sculpture intended to be placed in a street or
public place. The bill provided summary remedies for dealing with
pirated works. It omitted altogether any reference to registration,
and it provided for international copyright.</p>
</div>

<p>22. To sum up the position of artistic copyright in 1909, we
find five British acts, three dealing with engraving, one with
sculpture, and one with painting, drawing and photography,
and between them very little relation. We have three terms of
duration of copyright&mdash;28 years for engraving, 14 for sculpture,
with a second 14 if the artist be alive at the end of the first, life
and 7 years for painting, drawing or photography. There are
two different relations of the artist to his copyright. The
sculptor&rsquo;s right to sell his work and retain his copyright has
never been questioned so long as he signs and dates it. The
painter&rsquo;s copyright is made to depend upon the signing of a
document by the purchaser of his work. The engraver and the
sculptor are not required to register; but the author&rsquo;s name,
and the date of putting forth or publishing, must appear on his
work. The painter cannot protect his copyright without
registration, but this registration as it is now required is merely
a pitfall for the unwary. Designed to give the public information
as to the ownership and duration of copyrights, the uncertainty
of its operation results in the prevention of information on these
very points.</p>

<p>The Berlin Convention of 1908 led to the appointment of a
British committee to deal with its recommendations, and their
report in 1909 foreshadowed important changes in the law both
of literary and of artistic copyright, whenever Parliament
should give its attention seriously to the subject.</p>

<p>Difficult and complicated as is the whole subject of artistic
copyright, it is perhaps not to be wondered at that ignorance
of the law on the subject is very widespread, even
amongst those who are most interested in its action.
<span class="sidenote">Practical difficulties.</span>
One of the commonest beliefs amongst artists is, that
all they have to do to secure copyright is to register a
picture at Stationers&rsquo; Hall; but the authorities at Stationers&rsquo;
Hall ask no questions, and simply enter any particulars submitted
to them on their printed form. Some artists make a practice,
when they send a picture away to exhibition, to fill up one of these
forms, reserving the copyright by their entry to themselves, in
the belief that, if accompanied by the fee required by the
Hall, its entry will reserve the copyright to them, oblivious of the
fact that the only thing which can reserve the copyright to them
is the possession of a document assigning the copyright to them
by the purchaser of the picture. Another useless method of
attempting to reserve artists&rsquo; copyrights is that adopted by
the promoters of public exhibitions, with whom it is an almost
constant practice to print on some portion of the catalogue
of the exhibition a statement that &ldquo;copyrights of all pictures
are reserved,&rdquo; the impression apparently prevailing that a notice
of this kind effectively reserves the copyright for the artist while
selling his picture from the walls. It, of course, does no such
thing, and the copyright of any picture sold in these circumstances,
without the necessary document from the purchaser,
must be lost to the artist, and pass irrevocably into the public
domain.</p>

<p>In a work of art the work itself and the copyright are two totally
distinct properties, and may be held by different persons. The
conditions differ materially from those of a work of literature, in
which as a rule there is no value apart from publication. There is
a value in a work of art for its private enjoyment quite apart
from its commercial value in the form of reproductions; but
when the two properties exist in different hands, the person
holding the copyright has no power to force the owner of the work
of art to give him access to it for purposes of reproduction;
this can only be effected by private arrangement. It has been
argued that, as the two properties are so distinct, the owner of the
copyright ought to have the right of access to the picture for the
purpose of exercising his right to reproduce it. But it is easy to
see that it would destroy the value of art property if proprietors
knew that at any moment they might be forced to surrender
their work for the purpose of reproduction, though for a time
only.</p>

<p>There is often a strong sympathy between the artist and the
person who buys his picture, and it is not at all unusual, when
application is made to the owner of the picture for access to it,
for him to submit the question of reproduction to the artist.
Although the latter may really have no right in it, it is felt, as
a practical matter, that he is largely interested in the character
of the reproduction it is proposed to make. Hence the courtesy
which is usually extended to him.</p>

<p>Owing also to the increased facilities of reproduction, the
practice has become very common of splitting up copyrights and
granting licences in what may be described as very minute forms.
It would, of course, be impossible for a publisher to pay an artist
the sum at which he values his entire copyright, simply that he
might reproduce his picture in the form of a black-and-white
block in a magazine, and it has consequently become quite
common for the artist to grant a licence for any and every
particular form of reproduction as it may be required, so that
he may grant the right of reproduction in one particular form
in one particular publication, and even for a particular period
of time, reserving to himself thus the right to grant similar
licences to other publishers. This is apparently not to the injury
of the artist; it is probably to his advantage, and it certainly
promotes business.</p>

<p>23. The great obstacle in the way of securing a really good
Artistic Bill has been the introduction into it of photography.
It was by a sort of accident that the photographer was
given the same privileges as the painter in the bill of
<span class="sidenote">Photographs.</span>
1862. The promoters of the bill thought that the
photographer would be protected by the Engraving Acts which
covered prints; but since the photographers feared that, as
their prints were of a different character from the prints from a
plate, the Engraving Acts might not protect them, it was at the
last moment decided to put photography into the Art Bill. The
result of this was that the painter lost his chance of copyright on
all works executed on commission. Legislators feared that if
photographers held copyright in all their works the public would
have no protection from the annoyance of seeing the photographs
of their wives and daughters exhibited and sold in shop windows
by the side of &ldquo;professional beauties&rdquo; and other people, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
made articles of commerce. So in the case of commissioned works
the copyright was denied to both painters and photographers.</p>

<p>The royal commission which reported on the subject in 1878
proposed two distinct terms of copyright for painting and
photography. The term for the painter was dependent on his
life; that for the photographer was a definitely fixed term of
years from the date of publication of his photographs; and there
can be little doubt that this is the right way to deal with the two
branches of copyright. The artist who paints a picture signs it,
and there is no difficulty in knowing who is the author of a painting
and in whom the term of copyright is vested. In a very large
number of cases a photograph is taken by an employee, who is
here to-day and gone to-morrow, and even his employer knows
nothing of his existence. Of course, it may suit an employer to be
able to maintain secrecy as to the authorship of his negative,
inasmuch as it enables him to go on claiming copyright fees
indefinitely; but it is not to the public interest. In most
countries on the continent of Europe a photographer has the fixed
term of five years&rsquo; copyright in an original photograph dating
from its publication, which date, together with the name and
address of the photographer, has to be stamped on every copy
issued. In the public interest this is a good method of dealing
with photographs.</p>

<p>24. The &ldquo;authorship&rdquo; of a photograph has been much
debated in the law courts; and &ldquo;author&rdquo; was defined in
<i>Nollage</i> v. <i>Jackson</i> (1883) as &ldquo;the man who really represents or
creates, or gives to ideas, or fancy, or imagination, true local
habitation&mdash;the man in fact who is most nearly the effective
cause of the representation&rdquo; (<i>per</i> Lord Justice Bowen). He is not
necessarily the owner of the camera, or the proprietor of the business;
it depends on the circumstances. He is essentially the
person who groups and effectively superintends the picture. When
a photographer takes a portrait without fee, the copyright vests
in him and not in the sitter, who cannot prevent its publication;
but if the photograph is commissioned and paid for by the sitter
the copyright&mdash;in the absence of contrary stipulations&mdash;vests
in him, and he can restrain exhibition or multiplication of copies;
&ldquo;the bargain includes, by implication, an agreement that the
prints taken from the negative are to be appropriated to the use
of the customer only&rdquo; (Mr Justice North in <i>Pollard</i> v. <i>Photographic
Co.</i>, 1888). And this applies even when the sitter is not
the actual purchaser of the negative (<i>Boucas</i> v. <i>Cooke</i>, 1903).
But in several cases the &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; who has <i>sat</i> to a photographer
at his request and without payment has not been allowed
to distribute his photograph to newspapers for reproduction without
the photographer&rsquo;s consent. The fact that a sitter pays the
photographer for prints, though he has not commissioned the
sitting, would not vest the copyright in him.</p>

<p>25. The &ldquo;Living Pictures&rdquo; case in 1894 (<i>Hanfstängel</i> v.
<i>Empire Palace</i>) was a curious one. The Empire music-hall in
London produced some <i>tableaux vivants</i>, representing certain
pictures, of which Messrs Hanfstängel owned the copyright,
and an action was brought by them for an injunction. The
courts of chancery and of appeal decided against the plaintiffs, on
the ground that a reproduction of a painting must be by a
painting or something cognate; but in an action for infringement,
though the view already given was confirmed, the plaintiffs
succeeded so far as the backgrounds to the grouping were
concerned. Meanwhile two newspapers had published sketches
of the same <i>tableaux vivants</i>, and Messrs Hanfstängel brought
actions for infringement (<i>Hanfstängel</i> v. <i>Newnes</i>, and v. <i>Baines</i>,
1894). Mr Justice Stirling found for the plaintiffs, but on appeal,
and finally in the House of Lords, this decision was reversed.</p>

<p>26. <i>Copyright in Designs.</i>&mdash;An act of 1787 first gave protection
to printed designs on linen and cotton fabrics; and in 1839
a further act included designs on animal fabrics, or
mixed animal and vegetable fabrics; while in the same
<span class="sidenote">Designs.</span>
year another act protected designs for manufactured articles.
These acts had been preceded in France by laws of 1737 and
1744 creating a property by law in manufacturers&rsquo; designs. The
British law, which in various acts established a copyright (a) in
ornamental and (b) useful designs, was in 1883 consolidated in the
Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act, with amending acts up to
1888; and these acts were further consolidated and amended by
an act of 1905. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trade-marks</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Patents</a></span>.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">British Imperial Copyright Bill of 1910</p>

<p>The consolidation of the British copyright law, not only in the
United Kingdom but in the Dominions, and its amendment so
as to include the recommendations of the Berlin International
Convention of 1908, were the objects of a government bill
introduced into parliament by the president of the Board of
Trade on the 26th of July 1910, discussion on which was reserved
for a later period in the year. The passing of this bill, though
the date of it was uncertain owing to the peculiar circumstances
of English politics at the moment, was practically assured by
the facts that, apart altogether from the crying need for a revision
of the English law, the draft had previously been considered
and accepted, not only by a Board of Trade Committee which
reported unanimously in favour of the recommendations of the
Berlin Convention, but also by an Imperial Conference. The
bill for the first time brought British copyright entirely under
statutory law and consolidated and amended all previous
enactments; it adopted the suggestions of the Imperial Conference
(attended by representatives of Canada, Australia, South
Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland, other interests being
covered by home representatives of the Foreign Office, India
Office, Colonial Office and Board of Trade) as to providing for
its extension by their declaration to the Dominions; and with its
enactment a great simplification of the British law of copyright
came in sight, though for historical reasons the details given
above of the law as unamended must still remain of value.</p>

<p>Briefly, the new points of importance, apart from the placing
of all copyright on a purely statutory basis and the inclusion
of literary and artistic copyright within one arrangement, were
as follows. All compulsory formalities of registration were
abolished. The length of the period for which copyright lasted
was extended to the life of the author and 50 years after. This
reform was qualified, however, by a clause intended to protect
the public from its abuse, and providing that after the author&rsquo;s
death, if the work was withheld from the public or published
at too high a price, or if the reasonable requirements of the
public were not satisfied, a licence might be granted to publish
or perform it. These changes applied to all the subject-matters of
copyright, which were now put on the same level and treated
uniformly. In certain cases, already discussed above, protection
was extended: <i>e.g.</i> translations and lectures, original adaptations
and arrangements, works of artistic novelty, including
architectural designs; and the right to dramatize a novel or
&ldquo;novelize&rdquo; a drama was conferred in each case on the author.
Musical works were protected against unauthorized reproduction
by mechanical means without payment; but protection was
also extended to the mechanical record when authorized.</p>

<p>In including all sorts of intellectual product the bill followed
the recommendation (resolution 6) of the Imperial Conference
as to the definition of copyright (Parl. Paper Cd. 5272): &ldquo;the
Conference is of opinion that, subject to proper qualifications,
copyright should include the sole right to produce or reproduce
a work, or any substantial part thereof, in any material form
whatsoever and in any language, to perform, or in the case of a
lecture, to deliver, the work or any substantial part thereof in
public, and, if the work is unpublished, to publish the work, and
should include the sole right to dramatize novels and vice versa,
and to make records, &amp;c., by means of which a work may be
mechanically performed.&rdquo; As to architecture and artistic crafts
the Conference recommended (resolution 9) that &ldquo;an original
work of art should not lose the protection of artistic copyright
solely because it consists of, or is embodied in, a work of architecture
or craftsmanship; but it should be clearly understood that
such protection is confined to its artistic form and does not extend
to the processes or methods of reproduction, or to an industrial
design capable of registration under the law relating to designs and
destined to be multiplied by way of manufacture or trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the application of the new period of copyright to existing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
works, the Conference recommended (resolution 10) &ldquo;that
existing works in which copyright actually subsists at the
commencement of the new act (but no others) should enjoy,
subject to existing rights, the same protection as future works,
but the benefit of any extension of terms should belong to the
author of the work, subject, in the case where he has assigned
his existing rights, to a power on the part of the assignee at his
option either to purchase the full benefit of the copyright during
the extended term, or, without acquiring the full copyright, to
continue to publish the work on payment of royalties, the
payment in either case to be fixed by arbitration if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Conference was also of opinion (resolution 4a) that, under
the new Imperial Act, copyright should subsist only in works
of which the author was a British subject or bona fide resident
in one of the parts of the British Empire to which it extended;
and that copyright should cease if the work were first published
elsewhere than in such parts of the Empire.</p>

<p>The sensible basis on which the new bill was framed, and the
authority it represented, commended it, in spite of many controversial
points, to the acceptance both of the public and of
the various parties concerned. But nobody who had ever wrestled
with all the difficulties of international copyright, as complicated
by the law in the United States, would suppose that it was the
last word on the subject. What the bill did was to bring British
legislation into better shape, and to amend it on certain points
which had worked unjustly. The great distinction between the
requirements for British and for American copyright still remained,
namely, the American manufacturing clause. Perhaps
the most notable innovation was the clause enabling a licence
to be granted for the publication of a copyright work where the
owners of the copyright had not exercised it for the &ldquo;reasonable
requirements&rdquo; of the public. Some such clause was clearly
called for when the period of monopoly was being extended; but
the interpretation to be put upon the occasions which would
justify such interference might well be difficult. It may perhaps
be suggested that this innovation pointed to a reconsideration
of the true relations of &ldquo;publishers&rdquo; and &ldquo;authors&rdquo; (in the
widest sense) in respect of copyright, which sooner or later might
be approached from a different point of view. The new clause
was intended for the protection of the public from the mishandling
of an author&rsquo;s work after his death, while greater
protection was given him during his life. From a purely
business point of view, the question might well be whether a
publisher or other party not the author should have a copyright
at all, and whether equity would not be satisfied if copyright
vested solely in the author and his family, with liberty to any one
to &ldquo;publish&rdquo; on fair terms, consideration being had to an
original publisher&rsquo;s reasonable claims and existing contracts.
The advisability of any such advance on the principle now
asserted must depend rather on experience of actual business
and the working of the clause; but even under the procedure
provided by the bill of 1910 it would equally be imperative for
a publisher who owned a deceased author&rsquo;s copyright to show
that he had given or was giving the public valuable consideration
for his monopoly, in order to uphold it against any one willing,
on payment of a reasonable royalty, to serve the public better.</p>
